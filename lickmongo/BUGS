Lick Mongo can only drive one device at a time.  Involved with this is the fact
that Lick Mongo does not use any kind of transformation matrix.  Thus, the
transformation is recalculated for almost every point Lick Mongo draws.  This
also makes implementation of any kind of 3-d graphics impossible.

Lick Mongo's command parser is a nightmare to maintain for addition of new
commands.  It would be really nice to rewrite the parser in yacc, but
we are committed to support of a primarily Fortran-based Lick Mongo for
the sake of sites using Vista on VAXen.

Lick Mongo does not draw circles or ellipses.  Because Lick is a scientific
data-processing site, there really should be some way to easily draw
error ellipses given their covariance matrices.
