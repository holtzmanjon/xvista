ALL - predefined macro name that refers to the entire command buffer.
	Typing ALL will execute the contents of the command buffer, and ALL can
	be used as an argument for LIST, WRITE, and PLAYBACK.
ANGLE D - sets angle of text or points to D degrees. ANGLE will cause text
	from LABEL to come out D degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal. It
	also causes points to be rotated counter-clockwise by D degrees.
AUTOLWEIGHT N - Causes lineweight of plotted text to be automatically scaled.
	If N = 0, autolweight is turned off, else it is turned on.
AXIS A1 A2 ASMALL ABIG AX AY ALEN ILABEL ICLOCK
	Makes an axis labeled from A1 to A2 at location AX, AY, length ALEN.
	If ABIG > 0 use that for spacing of large ticks.
	If ASMALL < 0 make a logarithmic axis, if ASMALL = 0, reset to default.
	If ASMALL > 0 try to use that for the spacing of small ticks.
	ILABEL is 0 for no labels, 1 for labels parallel to axis, 2 for labels
	perpendicular to axis, 3 for parallel labels w/o ticks, 4 for
	perpendicular labels w/o ticks, 5 for a line w/o ticks or labels.
	ANGLE determines the angle of the axis.
	ICLOCK = 1 for clockwise ticks on the axis, 0 for counterclockwise.
BOX [I J [K L]] - Makes a box labeled according to LIMITS and TICKSIZE.
	BOX puts axes around the plot region, labeling the lower and left.
	If arguments I and J are included (default 1 and 2) they are
	used for the lower and left axes.
	If arguments K and L are included (default 0 and 0) they are
	used for the upper and right axes.
	The valid arguments are:
		-1: do not plot this side of the box,
		 0: do not plot any numbers along this axis,
		 1: plot numbers parallel to the axis,
		 2: plot numbers perpendicular to the axis,
		 3: plot numbers parallel without plotting axis or ticks
		 4: plot numbers perpendicular w/o axis or ticks,
		 5: plot axis without either ticks or numbers.
CHDIR PATH - Reset the current working directory to PATH.
	Only available with Unix.
COLOR N [R [G B]] - Select color for lines and characters, where N is the index
	into the current color table for the device.  If R is specified, then
	color N will be reset to gray level R, where 0<=R<1.  If G and B are
	specified, then color N will be reset to have red, green, and blue
	levels between 0 and 1 as specified by R, G, and B, respectively.
	The color table for a device is initialized when the TERM command is
	issued.  Color 0 is usually the background color for the device, and
	color 1 is usually the foreground color for the device.
	The number of colors available varies from device to device.
	Devices:
	       Term          Device             #colors
		____________________________________________
		 4      GSI color display       0 <= N < 256

		____________________________________________
	N.B.:  This command is still new enough that it may change.
CONNECT - Connects (x,y) pairs read by X and YCOLUMN with line segments.
	CONNECT draws line segments connecting the coordinates read by
	XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN.
CONTOUR - Makes a contour plot of an image read by the IMAGE command.
	The contour levels are set using the LEVELS command.
	This is available on VMS systems only.
CURSES - Displays the crosshair cursor to enable you to get positions (in world
	coordinates).  Positions are typed on the screen.  Exit the cursor
	routine by hitting the <ESC> key.
	NOTE: CURSES ISSUES A RELOCATE COMMAND TO SET THE CURRENT PLOT POSITION
	TO THE CURSOR POSITION.  THIS COMMAND IS ENTERED INTO THE COMMAND
	BUFFER SO IT MAY BE USED BY PLAYBACK.  THE CURSES COMMAND ITSELF IS NOT
	ENTERED INTO THE COMMAND BUFFER.
DATA FSPEC [STRING] - Opens the file "FSPEC" for reading data.
	DATA opens a data file for reading data.  The file is assumed to have
	numerical data in columns separated by spaces, tabs or commas.  Any
	column can be read as x or y coordinates by XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN.
	If the optional argument STRING is given, the data file will be
	searched for a line with STRING followed by a colon, and the line
	containing that STRING will become "line 0" of the file.
	Other data may be read in from the data file using ECOLUMN, PCOLUMN,
	DXCOLUMN, or DYCOLUMN (see below).  In the case that Lick Mongo has
	been called as a subroutine from a program, DATA with no arguments
	specifies that the data for plotting be taken from the data array
	passed as an argument of the Lick Mongo subroutine call.
DEFINE XXX - Creates macro "XXX" and enters define mode. DEFINE XXX creates an
	entry for a macro XXX, and subsequent commands until END are the body
	of the macro. The prompt changes to D* to indicate the mode. A macro is
	invoked by its name, and its name can be used as an argument to LIST,
	WRITE and PLAYBACK. The tokens &1, &2, ..., &9 can be used in the body
	of the macro, and when a macro is invoked its arguments will be
	substituted for these tokens.
DELETE [N1 [N2]] - Removes the commands N1-N2 from the command buffer.
	DELETE removes commands from the command buffer (numbered according to
	LIST). If no arguments, the last command is deleted, if one, that
	command is removed, and if two arguments all commands from one argument
	to the other are deleted.
DERIVATIVE [N] - Take the derivative of the data in x and y columns.
	This command destroys the original contents of these columns.
	This command should be followed by HISTOGRAM to show the slope between
	each consecutive pair of original data points.  If N is specified,
	the derivative will be evaluated at N equally spaced points.
	This is still experimental.
DEVICE N - Use TERMINAL instead of this command.
DOT - Makes a point of the current style at the current location.
	DOT draws a point at the current location (set by RELOCATE, DRAW, etc)
	in the style determined by PTYPE. The point's size and rotation are
	governed by EXPAND and ANGLE.
DRAW X Y - Draws a line to (x,y) from the last coordinate.
	DRAW draws a line to (x,y) from the current location (set by RELOCATE,
	DRAW, etc), and makes (x,y) the current location.
DXCOLUMN N - Reads vector X-displacements from column N of the current data
	file.  DXCOLUMN is used only in conjunction with the VFIELD interactive
	command, and DXCOLUMN must be issued (along with XCOLUMN, YCOLUMN, and
	DYCOLUMN) BEFORE executing VFIELD.
DYCOLUMN N - Reads vector Y-displacements from column N of the current data
	file.  DYCOLUMN is used only in conjunction with the VFIELD interactive
	command, and DYCOLUMN must be issued (along with XCOLUMN, YCOLUMN, and
	DXCOLUMN) BEFORE executing VFIELD.
ECHO [... VARIABLE ...] - Echo the string-substituted command line
	This is used for debugging contents of string variables of the sort
	set by the RCSTRING and SET commands.
ECOLUMN N - Reads the error bar size from column N of the data file.
	ECOLUMN reads column n from the data file as the magnitudes of the
	error bar displacements from the corresponding (x,y) coordinates. Note
	that X and YLOGARITHM do not adjust the error values to logarithmic
	coordinates.
EDIT -  Allows editing of the command buffer by your favorite editor.
	Under VMS this can be slow since it requires SPAWNing.
END -   Ends DEFINE mode, INSERT mode or exits from the program.
	In define mode END finishes the macro definition and returns to execute
	mode. In insert mode END returns to execute mode. In execute mode, END
	exits from the program altogether (as does ^Z in VMS, ^D in Unix).
ENUM -  Fill the X column with an array of ascending integers.
	The numbers run from 1 to the current number of Y points.
	This is experimental.
EPSLANDSCAPE [FILE [PAPSIZ]] - Initiates a landscape-mode Encapsulated PS plot.
	Encapsulated PostScript is suitable for direct inclusion into
	TeX, LaTeX, xfig, and many other drawing programs.  Editing one line
	makes the output suitable for transmission directly to a printer.
	See PSLANDSCAPE for other details.
EPSPORTRAIT [FILE [PAPSIZ]] - Initiates a portrait-mode Encapsulated PS plot.
	Encapsulated PostScript is suitable for direct inclusion into
	TeX, LaTeX, xfig, and many other drawing programs.  Editing one line
	makes the output suitable for transmission directly to a printer.
	See PSPORTRAIT for other details.
ERASE - Erases the graphics screen or initializes a Hardcopy plot.
	ERASE erases the graphics screen if in TERMINAL mode, or it
	reinitializes a hardcopy plot (sets the vector count to 0).
ERRORBAR K - Draws error bars on (x,y) pairs in direction 90(K-1) degrees.
	ERRORBAR is analogous to POINTS; it draws error bars on all (x,y)
	points (read by X and YCOLUMN) of length read by ECOLUMN. The argument
	is 1 to put the bar along the +x direction, 2 for +y, 3 for -x, and 4
	for -y. Use EXPAND to govern the size of the caps.
EXPAND E - Expands all characters or points by a factor E.
	EXPAND expands all characters and points, its default is 1.0.
	NOTE: With default expansion, characters are sent to the graphics
	terminal without font translation; in order to get characters of size 1
	with font translation, use EXPAND 1.0001.
GRID [N] - Makes a grid at major/all ticks for N = 0/1.
	Without an argument, GRID makes a grid of dotted lines at all major
	tick locations within a BOX. With an argument of 0 or 1, GRID makes a
	grid at major or all ticks of the current line type.
HALFTONE [MIN MAX] - Halftone plot of an image read by the IMAGE command.
	You may specify the intensity range for the plot, if not, the program
	will use the file max and min.
	    THIS COMMAND CHANGES THE SIZE OF THE PLOT WINDOW (LOCATION).
	The size of the new plot window depends on the size of the image file.
	Thus, if you want to draw axes for the plot, relocate and label,
	superimpose a contour plot, etc., you must do this AFTER calling
	HALFTONE.
	 * N.B. At present, this command works for the VT100 and Versatec, and
	the IMAGEN.  Use the IMLONG command (rather than IMPRINT) for use with
	the Imagen.  This command is only available on VMS systems.
HARDCOPY - Causes a stored hardcopy plot to be plotted.
	After a PSLANDSCAPE, PSPORTRAIT, VERSATEC, VTLONG, PRINTRONIX,
	IMPRINT, IMLONG or ERASE command all graphical output is stored.
	HARDCOPY causes the stored vectors to be plotted on the specified
	device.  Lick Mongo is then ready for another plot on the same device.
	On a Unix system with PostScript plots, the plot can be directed to
	any PostScript printer by setting the environment variable PSPRINTER
	to be the name of the desired printer.
HELP [COMMAND]- Prints an explanation of "COMMAND".
	Without an argument, HELP prints a one line description of ALL builtin
	commands. With an the name of a command as an argument, HELP prints
	more information on that command.
HISTOGRAM [N] - Connects <x,y> pairs from XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN as a histogram.
	A newly added feature is its acceptance of an optional argument which
	specified which color to use to shade the underside of the histogram.
	Requesting shading destroys the contents of the DX and DY
	column, and on X11 devices it also destroys the E column.
	This histogram shading only occurs on X11 and PostScript devices.
	The syntax for shading is new and still subject to change.
ID - Puts an identification label at the upper right corner of a plot.
	ID puts the name of the current input file, data file, date and time
	outside the upper right hand corner of the plot region.
IMAGE FSPEC - Reads an image from file "FSPEC".  VMS systems only.
	The file format is: floating point numbers, fixed record length,
	unformatted file.  See the Lick Mongo Manual for details.
IMLONG - Directs output to an Imagen laserprinter in Portrait mode.
	The Y axis is along the long edge of the page. See also IMPRINT.
IMPRINT - Directs output to an Imagen laserprinter in Landscape mode.
	IMPRINT directs graphical output to the Imagen and sets default values
	for the plot region location and device physical limits. The X axis is
	parallel to the long edge of the page. See also IMLONG.
INPUT FSPEC - Reads plot commands from file "FSPEC" and executes them.
	INPUT reads plot commands from a file and treats them exactly as if
	they were typed: commands are executed, or can be inserted or used in
	macro definitions.  See also the READ command
INSERT [N] - subsequent commands are inserted before command N in the
	command buffer.
	INSERT enters insert mode, indicated by a I* prompt, and subsequent
	commands are inserted without execution into the command buffer until
	an END command is encountered. Without an argument, INSERT inserts at
	the end of the buffer; with an argument, INSERT starts inserting just
	BEFORE the given location.
INTEGRAL - Integrate the data in x and y columns.
	This command destroys the original contents of these columns.
	This command should be followed by XSPLINE to show the result.
	The actual function integrated is the cubic spline which is shown by
	XSPLINE.  This is still experimental.
LABEL STRING - Writes "STRING" at the last pen coordinate.
	LABEL writes a string (which starts one space after LABEL and continues
	to the last non-space character) at the current location (set by
	RELOCATE, CURSES, etc). The string's size and angle are determined by
	EXPAND and ANGLE. The character "\" is an escape character and causes
	the following action.
	   _____________________________________
	    \\x - set mode x
	     \x - set mode x for next char
	     \r - Roman font
	     \g - Greek font
	     \s - script font
	     \t - tiny font
	     \i - toggle italics
	     \u - superscript
	     \d - subscript
	     \e - end string (optional)
	    \\\ - plot a backslash
	   _____________________________________
LEVELS [L1 [L2 [...]]] - Sets the contour levels for a contour plot.
	You may have up to 40 levels.  See the CONTOUR command.  VMS only.
LIMITS [X1 X2 [Y1 Y2]] - LIMITS sets the world coordinates of the plot region.
	All coordinates from X and YCOLUMN, RELOCATE, DRAW, etc, are referred
	to these limits. If LIMITS has no arguments, the data from the most
	recent XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN are used to set the limits.  If LIMITS has
	2 arguments, then the limits are set to span X1 in x and X2 in y
	with the region centered on the X- and YCOLUMN data.
	See also XLIMITS and YLIMITS.
LINES L1 [L2] - Limits Lick Mongo to reading lines L1-L2 in the current file.
	LINES sets the range of lines read from the current data file by
	the commands: XCOLUMN, YCOLUMN, ECOLUMN, DXCOLUMN, DYCOLUMN, and
	PCOLUMN.  It is useful to avoid non-data lines like file headers.
	If L2 is not given, Lick Mongo will start at line L1 and continue
	until it hits the end of the file.
LIST [XXX] - Lists the contents of the command buffer.
	If the argument "XXX" is given, LIST lists the commands of macro XXX.
	The numbers assigned to commands by LIST are those used by DELETE and
	INSERT.
LOCATION GX1 GX2 GY1 GY2 - Sets the physical location of the plot.
	This command deals with device coordinates--which should be avoided.
	See the SQUARE and RECT commands, and the MARGINS command.
	The plot region is a rectangle within the coordinates allowed by the
	plotting device.  It is made visible with the BOX command.  Note that
	labels will be outside this region.  Vectors and points are truncated
	at the bounds of the plot region.  LOCATION specifies (in device
	coordinates) where the plot region is located.  LOCATION is still the
	only way to make an arbitrary size and shape plot.  A useful size for
	PostScript output that does not fill a whole page (e.g., for
	transparencies) is (144--684, 144--504).
	____________________________________
	 * Default sizes:

	____________________________________
	NOTE: for PostScript devices (see PSxxx below), the units are
	in printer's points, not in pixels.  72 points = 1 inch.  The plot
	resolution depends on the device (Apple LaserWriters are 1/300 inch)
	LOCATION can be used to make an arbitrary size and shape plot.
LTYPE N - Sets the line type to N.
	All lines except for points and characters are drawn with line type n,
	where N refers to lines of the following type:
	     0 = solid
	     1 = dot
	     2 = short dash
	     3 = long dash
	     4 = dot - short dash
	     5 = dot - long dash
	     6 = short dash - long dash
LVISIBILITY N - Sets the visibility of the lines on Retros and GraphOns.
	     0 = on             (draw bright lines)
	     1 = off            (draw dark lines)
	     2 = toggle         (draw dark=>bright & bright=>dark)
	This command will soon change to accommodate modern (1990s) devices.
LWEIGHT N - Sets the line weight to N.
	All vectors plotted on hardcopies (e.g., PostScript, Versatec,
	Imagen, Printronix) are made with a weight of N.  The default
	line weight is 1.0 (1 pixel wide) on most devices, but with
	PostScript, the default line weight is 0.5 (1/2 point wide).
	This command can affect some terminals.  See also AUTOLWEIGHT.
MARGINS BOT LEFT TOP RIGHT - Allows you to specify the margins around a
	plot in inches.  You must first have chosen the device and expand
	that you will be using.  Lick Mongo will attempt to set the plot size
	such that no labels will intrude into the margins, but it may be
	necessary to iterate once to get the margins exactly right.
MAXDIGIT N - Sets the maximum number of digits to be plotted for axis labels.
	The default for this command is 10, but the number plotting routine
	ordinarily is able to figure out how many digits are significant, and
	only plot that many.  If you use TICKSIZE, however, there may be
	roundoff errors that confuse the number routine.  MAXDIGIT gets around
	this.
	  * NOTE: If you want the default, you must EXPLICITLY reset maxdigit
		  if you have changed it.
MINMAX - Returns with the max and min values of an image read by the IMAGE
	command. This may be useful for setting contour levels, or doing a
	halftone plot.  Only available on VMS systems.
NOTATION XLO XHI YLO YHI - Sets axis label format (exponential or floating).
	Defaults are XLO=YLO=1.E-4 and XHI=YHI=1.E5.  All numbers between these
	limits are written as floating point numbers, and all numbers outside
	this range are written with an exponent.  Notation allows you to change
	the limits for plotting exponential values.  If you set XLO=XHI and/or
	YLO=YHI, all values on that axis will be plotted using exponents.
PAGE N - After a VERSATEC command, directs output to N pages after 0th PAGE
	assumes VERSATEC output onto fanfold paper. It sets the physical limits
	and location so that vectors are offset onto page n after the first
	one.
PAUSE [N] - Lick Mongo will pause during the playback.  (For dramatic effect.)
	If N > 0, Lick Mongo will pause for up to N seconds.
	If N is not specified or N <= 0, Mongo will wait for a key to be hit.
	If N < 0, Lick Mongo will not type out "Mongo pause" while it pauses.
PCOLUMN N - Reads point type data from column N of the current data file.
	PCOLUMN is analogous to PTYPE, except that when POINTS is executed each
	(x,y) point is plotted with the corresponding entry in the point
	column, instead of the same point type for all points. The format is
	The same as PTYPE, except that the numbers are contracted together. If
	the entry has a fractional part, it is treated as an expansion factor
	(no fractional part means default expansion). For example, an an entry
	of 103.5 in a point column is the same as PTYPE 10 3, EXPAND .5.
PHYSICAL LX1 LY1 LX2 LY2 - Sets physical limits of plot.
	The plot region is a rectangle within the coordinates allowed by the
	plotting device.  PHYSICAL specifies (in device coordinates) the
	absolute limits of where graphics output can go.  Anything outside of
	these limits is truncated.  This command is really only useful for
	plot devices which can change their size, e.g., roll paper Versatec
	plots or plots on window systems.
PL3BOX [M N] - Makes a box, like the BOX command, but for use with PLT3D.
	BOX puts axes around the plot region, labeling the lower and left. If
	arguments M and N are included (default 1 and 2) they are used as
	ILABEL arguments for the lower and left axes.  (Kind of cruddy looking)
PLAYBACK [XXX] - Replay commands in the command buffer or macro "XXX".
	PLAYBACK XXX executes the macro XXX without storing the commands in the
	command buffer. With an argument of "all" or no argument, PLAYBACK
	replays all commands in the command buffer.
PLT3D ALT AZ ZFAC ZOFF - Makes a surface plot of the image.
	ALT and AZ determine the viewing angle. They determine the Altitude
	and the Azimuth of line of sight (in degrees).
	ZFAC is a multiplying factor, best set around 1/(data maximum).
	ZOFF sets the origin of the Z axis in data units.
	If Data(M/2,N/2) = -ZOFF, that point will be roughly in the center of
	the graphics area. A safe bet for ZOFF is 0.
	Only available on VMS systems.
POINTS - Draws points of the current style at the (x,y) of XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN.
	POINTS makes points of the current style (PTYPE), size (EXPAND), and
	rotation (ANGLE) at the coordinates read by XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN.
POLYGON N - Connect the current points as a polygon and fill it with color N.
	This is a new command and its syntax may be altered.  At the present,
	it only fills on X11 and PostScript plots.  Other devices just draw
	the outline of the polygon.  On X11 devices, use of POLYGON will
	destroy the values in ECOLUMN.
POSTSCRIPT STRING - emits "STRING" unaltered directly to the output
	PostScript device.  Not recommended unless you have an intimate
	knowledge of PostScript and how Lick Mongo generates it.
PRINTRONIX - Directs output to a Printronix line printer.
	This command is similar to VERSATEC.
PSFMODE N - Sets the font mode on a PostScript plot to N.
	PostScript plots can make use of a wide new range of fonts, but not
	all of the old symbols are available in the new fonts.
	    0 = use only stroked Hershey fonts
	    1 = use PostScript fonts for `Roman', Hershey fonts for all else
	    2 = use only PostScript fonts
	A sheet detailing all of the available PostScript font characters
	is available upon request.
PSFNAME IFONT NAME [ENCODING]- Change the font used on a PostScript plot.
	The default fonts used in PSFMODE 2 can be changed to any other font
	available on the LaserWriter by giving a PostScript font name.
	For the present, the fonts are reset every time PSLAND or PSPORT are
	used.  Thus, PSFNAME must be called for each plot.
	Note that precise spelling and capitalization are required in name.
	By default Lick Mongo uses the following PostScript fonts for PSFMODE 2.
	 IFONT | \?  (meaning)      | Default PostScript font NAME
	 ------+--------------------+---------------------------------
	   0   | \r  (Regular)      | /Helvetica
	   1   | \g  (Greek/Symbol) | /Symbol
	   2   | \s  (Script)       | /ZapfChancery-MediumItalic
	   3   | \t  (Typewriter)   | /Courier
	   4   | \i  (Italic)       | /Helvetica-Oblique
	   5   | \o  (Other)        | /ZapfDingbats
	By using ENCODING, you can select a different PostScript encoding
	vector for the fonts.  This will usually be set to ISOLatin1,
	which enables the use of most western European characters--including
	the "A-ring" character used to denote Aangstroms.  (But surely
	you all are using the IAU recommended nanometers, right?)
PSLANDSCAPE [FILE [PAPSIZ]] - Initiates a PostScript plot in landscape mode.
	Landscape is oriented with the X-axis along the long side of the page.
	If "FILE" is specified, the output will be placed in that file and
	will not be queued for printing.  Use HARDCOPY to finish the plot.
	If "PAPSIZ" is specified, Mongo will use it to select a paper tray.
PSPORTRAIT [FILE [PAPSIZ]] - Initiates PostScript plot in portrait mode.
	Portrait is oriented with the Y-axis along the long side of the page.
	If "FILE" is specified, the output will be placed in that file and
	will not be queued for printing.  Use HARDCOPY to finish the plot.
	If "PAPSIZ" is specified, Mongo will use it to select a paper tray.
PTYPE N S [STRING] - Sets the point type to an N-gon of style S.
	PTYPE N S causes points to be drawn as N sided polygons of a style S,
	where S refers to:
	   0 = open
	   1 = skeletal (center connected to vertices)
	   2 = stellated
	   3 = solid
	----
	If S is negative, then N is irrelevant, and Lick Mongo looks for a
	string at the end of the command line.  When the DOT or POINTS command
	is used, that text string will be placed at each point.
	----
	If N is negative, then it will be interpreted as a decimal ASCII code,
	and S will be used as the number of the font (see PSFNAME).  When the
	DOT or POINTS command is used, ASCII character N in font S will be
	placed at each point.
PUTLABEL L STRING - Writes label "STRING" at the current location justified
	according to code L.
	PUTLABEL writes a label at the current location with rotation and size
	specified by ANGLE and EXPAND (exactly like LABEL). The label is
	oriented with respect to the current location according to the argument
	L which can be 1 - 9 for:
			  right  center  left  justified
			 ---------------------
	label above         7      8      9
	      centered      4      5      6
	      below         1      2      3
			 ---------------------
QUARTER N - Use WINDOW instead.
	In VERSATEC or PRINTRONIX mode, sets the plot region to quarter N
	of the page.  QUARTER sets the plot region to one quarter of a
	Versatec or Printronix page, where N = 0, 1, 2, or 3 for upper left,
	right, lower left and right areas.
RCSTRING STRINGVAR RESOURCE - Find RESOURCE: in datafile and read STRINGVAR
	THIS COMMAND IS COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL--SYNTAX MAY CHANGE.
	Lick Mongo searches the open datafile for RESOURCE followed by a colon.
	That line after the colon is stored in a Mongo macro called STRINGVAR.
	After STRINGVAR is defined, it can be invoked by prepending "&$" to
	the string name.  E.g., if STRINGVAR is "YOW", then any occurrance
	of &$YOW will be replaced with the line read from the open datafile.
	See also the SET command.
RDSTRING STRINGVAR LINE# - Read a line of the open datafile into a string.
	THIS COMMAND IS LIKELY TO BE REMOVED FROM EXISTENCE.  SEE RCSTRING.
	Reads line LINE# into macro STRINGVAR.
	See RCSTRING for more details using the value of the string.
READ FSPEC - Read macro in file "FSPEC" into command buffer.
	READ does not execute the macro, but simply reads it into the command
	buffer, from whence it may be edited, and/or executed with PLAYBACK.
RECT   - Like BOX but forces aspect ratio of world coordinates to be true.
	RECT gives precedence to the device limits, and expands the user
	coordinate limits as necessary to achieve a 1:1 aspect ratio.
	This means that WINDOW plots with SUBMARGINS 0 0 will be adjacent.
RELOCATE X Y - Sets the current coordinates to (X,Y).
	RELOCATE sets the current location to (X,Y) without drawing a line.
RESET - Resets all the setable variables back to their defaults.
REVERSE N - if N > 0 reverses the background xcolor to color 1. If N < 0,
	reverses the background back to the original color 0.
RLABEL STRING - Plots "STRING" at the RIGHT of the current plot, in a
	similar fashion to YLABEL.
RLIMITS RMIN RMAX - Limits the longest and shortest vectors in a field.
	Vectors with SQRT(DX**2 + DY**2) outside these limits will not appear.
SET STRINGVAR ANY TEXT - Sets a string variable to contain ANY TEXT
	THIS COMMAND IS COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL--SYNTAX MAY CHANGE.
	SET permits any string variable to be set to any value.
	This is a shortcut rather than using RCSTRING from an external file.
SHOW - Shows current limits and location.
	SHOW lists the values of some the variables, including current location
	and plot region limits in world and device coordinates, the value of the
	expansion and angle variables, the line type and weight, and the
	physical limits.
SKIPCHARS N - Allows Lick Mongo to ignore the first N characters in a line.
	This means that there may be non-numeric stuff at the beginning of a
	line and Lick Mongo will simply skip past it before reading data.
	N.B.--Tabs count as 1 (One) character.
SOFTPHYSICAL xmin xmax ymin ymax [xfac yfac rfac tfac] - same as physical
	but without resetting the hardware itself. xfac, etc., if given,
	alter the amount of room Lick Mongo leaves for labels on each edge of
	the plot.
STRINGS N [M] - Read the strings found in the column N and plot them at X & Y
	This command is extremely new, experimental, and may still change.
	It works like POINTS, using the positions read by X and YCOLUMN,
	but it plots the string found in column N instead of geometric figures.
	An optional argument M will be used as in the PUTLABEL command to
	adjust the position of the label.
SQUARE - Like BOX but forces aspect ratio of world coordinates to be true.
	SQUARE gives precedence to the user limits set with LIMITS, and shrinks
	the graphics region as necessary to achieve a 1:1 aspect ratio.
	RECT may be preferable if making use of WINDOW and SUBMARGINS.
SUBMARGINS X Y - Allows control of the margins around plot windows made
	with the WINDOW command.  Not using SUBMARGINS is equivalent to
	SUBMARGINS 1. 1. , which leaves the margins as they always have been.
	SUBMARGINS 0. 0. makes the margins around the windows zero size in
	both x and y.  This allows plot windows to be adjacent to each other.
	SUBMARGINS must be used before the WINDOW command.
TCONTOUR - Like CONTOUR except uses the MPGCONT contour following algorithm.
	This will produce better results on a pen plotter and if a non-solid
	line type is in use.  Only on VMS systems.
TERMINAL N - Directs output to a graphics terminal with device code N.
	TERMINAL directs graphical output to the graphics terminal and sets
	default values for the plot region location and device physical limits.
	An optional argument is used to specify a particular device.

	A second optional argument specifies the device name, e.g.,
	`TTA0:' on a VMS system, `/dev/ttyh1' on a Unix system, or
	`-display eos:0 -geometry 640x480+0-0' for an X11 window.
TICKSIZE SMALLX BIGX SMALLY BIGY - Sets tick intervals for BOX.
	SMALLX refers to the interval between small tick marks on the x axis,
	BIGX refers to the interval between large ticks, etc.
	If BIG is 0, the axis routine will supply its own intervals according
	to the label limits.
	If SMALL < 0, the axis will have logarithmic tick spacing with large
	ticks at each decade and small ones at each integer.
	When SMALL < 0, BOX assumes that the limits are LOGARITHMS,
	e.g., -2 and 2 refers to limits of .01 and 100.
TLABEL STRING - Plots "STRING" at the TOP of the current plot, in a
	similar fashion to XLABEL.
UNDEFINE [MACNAME] - Removes the macro named MACNAME from the macro buffer.
	When invoked with no argument, UNDEFINE lists currently defined macros.
	This command is new; it may be changed into something like REDEFINE.
VECTOR X Y DX DY - Plots a vector (arrow).  The tail of the vector is at
	(X,Y), and the head is at (X+DX,Y+DY).  If VFIELD has previously
	been used, the vector is scaled in length as the VFIELD was.
VERSATEC - Directs output to the Versatec on one 8x10 sheet.
	VERSATEC directs graphical output to the Versatec and sets default
	values for the plot region location and device physical limits.
	VERSATEC orients the plot so that x increases along the paper
	perforation and y out of the machine.  VMS only for the present.
VFIELD - Plots a vector field as a set of arrows at each (X,Y) position with
	x displacement DX and y displacement DY.  The lengths of the arrows are
	determined from the average values of SQRT(DX**2+DY**2),
	but may be changed with the EXPAND command. (X,Y) positions must first
	be read in from a file using the XCOLUMN and YCOLUMN commands, vector
	displacements must be read in from a file with the DXCOLUMN
	and DYCOLUMN commands.
VTLONG - Directs rotated output to the Versatec for roll paper.
	VTLONG directs graphical output to the Versatec and sets default values
	for the plot region location and device physical limits. VTLONG orients
	the plot so that x increases into the machine and y increases across
	the paper. VTLONG allows arbitrarily long plots.
WINDOW NX NY K - Sets the plot location to a subwindow.
	WINDOW allows the user to subdivide the plotting area into subwindows,
	and select which subwindow is "active."  NX is the number of horizontal
	subwindows and NY is the number of vertical subwindows.  The value of K
	selects the the active subwindow.  Subwindows are numbered from
	the lower left corner, increasing left to right, then bottom to top.
	Thus, K=1 specifies the first subwindow. WINDOW 1 1 1 resets the plot
	location to be the entire plotting area.   NOTE:  you must do this
	BEFORE changing the area location (see LOCATION) or the plotting device.
WRITE XXX FSPEC - Writes macro "XXX" to file "FSPEC".
	WRITE the commands making up a macro to a file. If the macro name given
	is "all" the entire command buffer is written to the file.
WXFRAC [F1 [F2 [F3 [...]]]] - sets the relative sizes of subwindows in X
	WXFRAC allows alteration of the sizes of subwindows created with WINDOW.
	Each argument is taken as the relative size of the Nth subwindow in the
	X direction.  Thus WXFRAC 2 1 followed by WINDOW 2 2 1 would make
	the leftside windows twice as wide as the rightside windows.
WYFRAC [F1 [F2 [F3 [...]]]] - sets the relative sizes of subwindows in Y
	WYFRAC allows alteration of the sizes of subwindows created with WINDOW.
	Each argument is taken as the relative size of the Nth subwindow in the
	Y direction.  Thus WYFRAC 2 1 followed by WINDOW 2 2 1 would make
	the bottom windows twice as wide as the top windows.
X11GEOMETRY WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y set the X11 geometry for opening the window.
	The argument is a string which has the standard X11 geometry format.
XCOLUMN N - Reads X-axis data from column N of the current file (see DATA).
	XCOLUMN reads column N from the data file as the values of the x
	coordinates of the data points.
XLABEL string - Writes the label "string" centered under the X axis.
XLIMITS XMIN [XMAX] - Changes the values of the X axis limits but leaves the
	Y-axis limits UNCHANGED.
	Issuing XLIMITS without arguments will automatically set the X axis
	limits to appropriate values based on the data read in with the
	last XCOLUMN command.  XLIMITS with one argument will set the range
	of the world coordinates centered on the data read by XCOLUMN.
XLOGARITHM [XLMIN] - Takes the logarithm of x values from XCOLUMN.
	The value of XLMIN is optional.  For 0 or negative numbers,
	XLMIN is used for the logarithm.  XLMIN defaults to -50.
XSIXTY [N] - Converts decimal x values to sexagesimal (time or degrees).
	This must be done AFTER the call to XCOLUMN, and must be done each time
	you call XCOLUMN. The data for XCOLUMN are expected to be in units of
	the lowest field (i.e. seconds for degree, min, seconds).  The values
	will be plotted with N decimal places (default=0).
XSPLINE - Like connect except that a cubic spline is used.
	XSPLINE requires that the X data be in increasing order.
	The spline is based on the natural spline in Numerical Recipes,
	but is adapted to allow more than one Y value at each X value.
YCOLUMN N - Reads y data from column N of the current file (see DATA).
	YCOLUMN reads column N from the data file as the values of the y
	coordinates of the data points.
YLABEL string - Writes the label "string" centered left of the Y axis.
YLIMITS YMIN [YMAX] - Changes the values of the Y axis limits but leaves the X
	axis limits UNCHANGED.
	Issuing YLIMITS without arguments will automatically set the Y axis
	limits to appropriate values based on the data read in with the last
	YCOLUMN command.  YLIMITS with one argument will set the range
	of the world coordinates centered on the data read by YCOLUMN.
YLOGARITHM [YLMIN] - Takes the logarithm of y values from YCOLUMN.
	The value of YLMIN is optional.  For 0 or negative numbers,
	YLMIN is used for the logarithm.  YLMIN defaults to -50.
YSIXTY [N] - Converts decimal y values to sexagesimal (time or degrees).
	This must be done AFTER the call to YCOLUMN, and must be done each time
	you call YCOLUMN. The data for YCOLUMN are expected to be in units of
	the lowest field (i.e. seconds for degree, min, seconds) The values
	will be plotted with N decimal places (default 0).
