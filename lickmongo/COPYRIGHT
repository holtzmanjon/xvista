The package known as Lick Mongo is based upon the package called MONGO 1983.1
which was originally assembled by John Tonry.  Let no one doubt the fact
that MONGO was created by John Tonry.
*******************************************************************************
Lick Mongo is distributed by
University of California Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/LO)
in accordance with a letter of understanding between UCO/LO and
John L. Tonry.

Under the terms of the agreement, UCO/LO is able to distribute Lick Mongo
to other sites which can provide evidence of a valid MONGO license.
Information on how to obtain a valid MONGO license can be obtained from
John L. Tonry by email to jt@antares.mit.edu or by writing to him at
MIT 6-204
Cambridge, MA  02139

Details regarding the acquisition of Lick Mongo may be obtained by sending
an email message to mongo@helios.ucsc.edu or by writing to

*******************************************************************************
Numerous additions and modifications have been made to the original code.
The package known as Lick Mongo has existed since 1987, and as its name implies
Lick Mongo is the code as it exists at the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory.
The changes have been made by more than a dozen different individuals who
were based at various state and private institutions all over the world.

At this time it is very difficult to determine exactly which code originated
with which author at which site.  The individual functions and subroutines
will be edited to add authorship comments as best as can be reconstructed.
There are some routines which are not derived from John Tonry in any way.
These sections of code will be split out into separate files which will
be housed in a separate directory of code.

There are undoubtedly individuals or institutions other than those listed
below who hold copyright to some portions of the code.  Information
regarding the nature of such copyrights is welcomed for inclusion into
future distributions of this code.

In the mean time, the following copyrights do apply to the code.
*******************************************************************************
Much of the source code in the Lick Mongo package is derived from the original
MONGO 1983.1 code.  This applies especially to the code which forms the
interactive command interpreter.
This code falls under the following copyright:
C
C  Copyright (c) 1983 John L. Tonry
C  All Rights Reserved

*******************************************************************************
Some of the source code in the Lick Mongo package is derived from work
done at UC Santa Cruz, Lick Observatory, University of California
Observatories, and UC Berkeley by employees in the course of their duties.
As such, these segments of code fall under the following copyright:
C
C  Copyright (c) 1992 The Regents of the University of California
C
C  Different portions of Lick Mongo are covered by different copyrights.
C  Based on licensing agreements executed between UCO/Lick Observatory and
C  John L. Tonry, those sections of code supplied by or derived from code
C  supplied by Tonry are copyright John L. Tonry.  Those sections of code
C  developed by employees of the University of California, in the course
C  of their employment, using University funding or facilities are copyright
C  the Regents of the University of California.  Those sections of code
C  developed by graduate students as part of their student assignments
C  or research endeavors would normally belong to the individual student.
C
C  The present Copyright Policy of the University of California is
C  imprecise on the question of copyright ownership of software developed
C  by graduate students who are also University employees.  It is also
C  imprecise regarding copyright ownership of software which was developed
C  by non-employee graduate students using University-funded computing
C  facilities.  UCO/Lick has attempted to obtain from the University
C  a more definitive written statement of policy on these issues, but so
C  far the various offices contacted have only agreed that this is a
C  "gray area."  Given this situation, UCO/LO has elected to assert a
C  joint copyright notice in those sections of code which fall into this
C  gray area, e.g.:
C
C  Copyright (c) 1991 JohnDoe and/or the Regents of the University of California
C
C  In so doing, UCO/LO is asserting that the relevant sections of code are
C  copyrighted.  Such code is thus subject to the restrictions imposed
C  by the additional text incorporated in such copyright notices.

Some of the source code in the Lick Mongo package is derived from original
work done by Richard W. Pogge.  Most of the PostScript device driver code
and some other code falls under the following copyright:

Some of the source code in the Lick Mongo package is derived from original
work done by Steven L. Allen.  Specifically covered by this are the makefiles,
the "make" files, and the CPP #include files which allow the code to be
automatically portable to so many different operating systems.  Such code
falls under the following copyright:

C  the nature of the modification is documented in the source with this

C
C  The author feels that portability of software is of sufficient importance
C  that schemes like the one used in Lick Mongo should be applied to other
C  codes (subject, of course, to the constraints of any existing copyrights).
C  All persons are encouraged to use similar schemes for the purpose
C  of freeing other software packages from the bondage of a single platform.

Most of the fund-granting agencies which may have sponsored the work that
generated the various bits of code are lost in antiquity.  Trying to list all
of them would produce a list far more incomplete than the above copyright list.
