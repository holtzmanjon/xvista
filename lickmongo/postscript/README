			PostScript in Lick Mongo

This directory contains files which are used for generation and printing
of PostScript.  The active versions of these files are also linked up into
the next higher directory ("/mongodir").

PSprint             | cshell script which is invoked to print PS files
dodot.ps            | PostScript macro for drawing Lick Mongo points
dodot.orig          | older version
mongolabel.old      | PS macro for full Mongo labeling--no comments
mongolabel.ps       | PS macro for full Mongo labeling--Apple LaserWriter fonts
simputlabel.ps      | PS macro for simple labeling
simputlabel.orig    | older version

The PSprint cshell script is tailored for Lick Observatory's printers and
will need to be changed.  All it really needs is to invoke the correct command
to print a PostScript file on your system.

The mongolabel.* macros use fonts which are likely to be found on most
PostScript printers.  If necessary, changing mongolabel.ps to use other fonts
is a simple procedure of editing the top few lines.

These macros also contain lots of comments which may be processed rather slowly
by your host machine if it is slow (e.g., a 4.3bsd VAX11/780 with high load).
These can be removed if desired for faster printing.  If they are removed, then
the "Config.(yourmachinehere)" file should be modified to include the CPP line
#define NO_PS_COMMENTS
and the .../lick/source/devices/psdrivers.F file should be recompiled.  This
will significantly speed up the execution of Lick Mongo while it generates
the PostScript plot files.
