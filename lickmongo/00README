LickMongo Installation Instructions
Last Update: 1996 June 23 

   In what is below, /mypath/ is the path to where you will install the
   software, and "machine" is the flavor of machine you are on, where:

   machine = solaris for Sun Sparcs running Solaris 4.x (aka: SunOS 5.x)
           = sun4 for Sun Sparcs running SunOS 4.x
           = osf1axp for DEC Alphas running OSF1

   The raw source distribution is ~3Mb, and requires ~4Mb total
   with all binaries and libraries.  Only Sun4, Solaris, DEC Alpha, and
   Linux are fully supported at present, but hooks are in place for other
   architectures, but you are mostly on your own with those.


1) Unpacking

   You need to unpack the source-only distribution into the directory
   tree where you wish to install LickMongo.  The tar file (tape or 
   compressed tar via anonymous ftp) will create a lickmongo/
   directory tree with the source code.


   a) tape distribution:

        % cd /mypath/
        % tar xvf /dev/nrst? 
        
      (replace ? by the tape device ID). 

   b) ftp compressed tar distribution (file pvtar.Z)

        % cd /mypath/
        % zcat lmtar.Z | tar xvf -

      Don't remove lmtar.Z until you are sure things work.

        
2) Installing LickMongo


*********************************
IMPORTANT STUFF BEFORE YOU START!

You *must not be root* when installing LickMongo.  The best thing to do is
to setup a separate "maintenance" account with login name "mongo", to allow
a non-root user to maintain the package.  The reason for this is
LickMongo's autoconfiguring make file, which needs to be able to execute
programs in ./, a security problem for root-level users.

The second major source of first-time problems is that the mongo user
account is often configured with the wrong path, so that ./ is not the
first item in the PATH.  Further, you must make sure that all paths to
compilers and their libraries are correct for your site.

*********************************

   To build LickMongo on your system, you need to work in the source/
   directory:

        % cd /mypath/lickmongo/source

   You need to modify the file Config.machine.  The only lines that
   should need modification are to replace "/path/" with whatever /mypath/
   above is.  These point to the LickMongo auxillary libraries.

        % cp Config.machine Config.machine.old
        % <your-favorite-editor> Config.machine

   Now clear out any stale executables or libraries

        % make clean
        % rm make.barf (may already be gone)

   And build the package

        % make >& make.barf &

   This takes about 10-20 minutes on a Sparc 5/10 class machine.  Examine
   "make.barf" for errors,

	% grep -i error make.barf

   will help you find most compiler and loader errors.

   Try running the mongo it built

        % mongo.machine

   do the following

        * term 11
        * expand 2
        * box

   It should be able to find the local binary font tables, open an X11
   window and draw a box with oversized labels.

   If it works, install it:

        % make install

   The executable (mongo.machine) and libraries (libmgo.machine.a)
   will reside in /mypath/lickmongo/


3) Troubleshooting:
   
   If it cannot open an X11 window, it could not find the X11 libraries,
   see and then execute the .../source/Xwhere csh script and modify the make
   file appropriately after determining what search strategy finds
   the X libraries.  If your sysadmin has followed standard practice
   (e.g., windows as installed with Solaris or SunOS by the factory),
   this will be unnecessary.  If your sysadmin has gotten clever, you
   may need to play around.  Once you have done make, go back to
   the installation at top again (after modifying Config.machine)

   If it cannot find the font tables, if on a big-endian machine (Sparcs)
   do the following

        % cd /mypath/lickmongo
        % cp fonts.big/* .

   If on a small-endian machine (Alpha) do
        
        % cd /mypath/lickmongo
        % cp fonts.ltl/* .

   And then 

        % cd source
        % mongo.machine

   and try the test again with the repaired fonts.


4) System Installation:

   On some systems, you will want mongo and its libraries to be globally
   accessible to all users.  This is best done by installing appropriate
   symbolic links as follows:

   In /usr/local/bin:

	ln -s /mypath/lickmongo/mongo.machine mongo

   which makes an executable object, "/usr/local/bin/mongo"

   In /usr/local/lib:

	ln -s /mypath/lickmongo/libmgo.machine.a libmgo.a

   which makes a linkable library: "/usr/local/lib/libmgo.a"

   These are suggestions, some sites use different conventions for
   local binaries and libraries added onto their basic systems.

   A man-page, mongo.l, is available for installation under your
   local man pages, but is somewhat out of date.
