<P>
VISTA is an interactive image and spectral reduction and analysis package
developed at the Lick Observatory.  It is a package which is designed to
allow efficient reduction and analysis of astronomical observations.

<P>
Many other such packages exist. Some possible advantages of VISTA are that
the routines are primarily memory-based, leading to relatively fast
execution, routines are command-line driven using optional keywords for
easy use, and a convenient display interface. Perhaps most importantly, it
is relatively easy to add new commands/features into VISTA or to modify
existing ones, once one becomes familiar with the programming
structure. VISTA is programmed predominantly in FORTRAN.  An introductory
programmers guide to VISTA is available from
<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://astro.nmsu.edu/~holtz/vista">http://astro.nmsu.edu/~holtz/vista</A>.

<P>
This is the manual for VISTA version 5.0, released July 1998.  For
information on how to obtain the VISTA package and/or how to install it on
your system, check the URL
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://astro.nmsu.edu/~holtz/vista">http://astro.nmsu.edu/~holtz/vista</A>
or see Appendix A of this manual.

<P>
We wish to note that no one officially supports Vista, so we cannot
guarantee any of the results. All problems, comments, etc. should be
addressed to the Vista distributor (holtz@nmsu.edu), and, although we
cannot guarantee a response, we generally try to help.

<P>
The manual for VISTA is fairly extensive, with many examples for commands.
Many sections of the manual give examples of procedures, showing how a
particular command can be combined with others to create common
data-reduction operations.
