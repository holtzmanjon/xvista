<P>
ELLMAG calculates the elliptical magnitude within the elliptical isophote
fit using the PROFILE command.  It uses the values for the surface
brightness computed previously by PROFILE.  It recomputes the circular
totals using CIRCMAG, so that any results appended to the PROFILE results
with EMAG will have appropriate circular totals all the way out to the
final radius.

<P>
This routine differs from EMAG in that the magnitudes within each ellipse
in the PROFILE common block are computed, correctly taking into account the
varying position angles and eccentricities.  EMAG, by contrast, computes
concentric elliptical magnitudes given the parameters for ONE of the
ellipses in the PROFILE common block.

<P>
This routine uses the SB results to approximate the elliptical totals
within increasing semi-major axis radii.  For each increase in radius, the
routine approximates the additional ellipse area which needs to be taken
into account for calculating the elliptical totals.  It then multiplies the
SB value at that radius by this area to get an approximation of the extra
number of counts to add to the elliptical total.  The routine does take
into account the possibility of crossing ellipses but, at this time, does
not yet take into account the possibility of changing position angle.
