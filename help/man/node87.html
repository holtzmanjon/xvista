<P>
PLOT produces a plot of a selected rows, columns, or spectra for up to 15
different images, using the LickMongo plotting package. All the specified
buffers will come out on the same plot, or each successive specified buffer
can come out in a series of windows (with the number of horizontal and
vertical windows specified by the NH= and NV= keywords). If desired, all
the plots can come out in a single subwindow using the WIND= keyword.
PLOT also allows the possibility of hardcopy on your hardcopy device
(as specified by the TERM HARCOPY= command).

<P>
The index 'buf' specifies which of the image buffers contains the image for
plotting a row or column. No 'buf' is needed to plot results from the
PROFILE or the MULT common block, which contain profiles determined with
the PROFILE or SNUC command.  The optional index 'box' specifies one of the
10 available boxes (see BOX command) to be used to select a sub-section of
an image. Row 'n' is displayed by using the option R=n, column 'n' by using
the C=n option, and spectrum 'n' by using no option. The RS and CS keywords
are used to display the sum of the selected rows or columns in an image.

<P>
Normally the endpoints of the x- and y-axes are selected in this way: The
x-axis runs over the entire row, column, or spectrum selected. The minimum
and maximum y-values define the corresponding limits for the y-axis.

<P>
XS and XE override this autoscaling and allow you to set the limits along
the X-axis.  XS and XE refer to the starting and ending X values in pixels
(or Angstroms for a spectrum with a wavelength scale determined.)  If the
USER option is defined, XS and XE are in the user-defined coordinates.
MIN and MAX override the autoscaling and allow the user to set the limits
along the Y-axis.

<P>
The keyword GRID will produce a coordinate grid on the plot.  This is very
useful if you are trying to make measurements from a hard copy plot.  The
keyword INFO will put some additional information onto the plot.

<P>
LOG and SEMILOG will produce Log-Log or Log-Linear plots as desired.  The
R4 keyword will plot  along the x-axis, particularly useful when
plotting the output image from PROFILE. NOLABEL prevents the drawing of
axis labels and the name of the image or spectrum.  Use this with NOERASE
to overplot several graphs.  The OLD keyword will produce a plot using the
last used set of parameters.

<P>
If multiple window are desired, use the NH= and NV= keywords to set the
number of windows in the horizontal and vertical directions,
respectively. The plots of b1, b2, b3 ... will appear in the window
starting in the upper left and progressing right across the page and then
down. If limits are specified with MIN and MAX, e.g., all windows will have
these limits. If no limits are specified, each window will autoscale
individually.

<P>
If you wish all plots to be sent to a subwindow, use the WIND= keyword,
with three parameters following the normal LickMongo syntax; number of
windows in the x direction, number of windows in the ydirection, and
a specification of which window to draw into (e.g. WIND=2,3,5 will
draw in the upper left window of a 2x3 layout).

<P>
HARD will send the plot to the hardcopy device as specified by the TERM
command (or the default device). If you use the PSFILE=file option,
PostScript output is sent to the specified file, rather than directly to
the printer.  The PORT keyword will make a Portrait mode plot (long side of
the paper vertical), and EPS will make an Encapsulated PostScript file.
EPS should be used in conjunction with the PSFILE= keyword to create the
EPS file.

<P>
The MACRO=file keyword can be used to execute the Mongo macro file 'file'
after each plot is made.  This provides a way to add additional annotation
or data to a plot (especially for preparation of figures for papers or
talks).

<P>
INT is an alternative to MACRO= that invokes an interactive LickMongo shell
allowing users to enter plot annotations and other commands interactively.
Note that if this is done on a screen plot you need to use the WRITE ALL
... command in LickMongo to save the macro, then when you make a hardcopy
you can use the MACRO= keyword to execute the LickMongo commands.)  If
MACRO= and INT are both specified, the macro file will be executed before
the user is put into the interactive LickMongo shell.

<P>
USER will scale and label the axes according to the user-defined
coordinates instead of pixels.  This is done using the CRVALn, CRPIXn,
CDELTm, CTYPEn and BUNIT cards in the image (or spectrum) FITS header.  The
conversion between user coordinates and pixels is given by:

 SRC="img176.png"
 ALT="\begin{hanging}
\item{X = CRVAL1 + CDELT1 * FLOAT(COL - CRPIX1)}
\end{hanging}">
<BR>
for Columns, or

<IMG

 SRC="img177.png"
 ALT="\begin{hanging}
\item{X = CRVAL2 + CDELT2 * FLOAT(ROW - CRPIX2)}
\end{hanging}">
<BR>
for Rows, where
<DL COMPACT>
<DT></DT>
<DD>CRPIXn = INTEGER equal to the starting pixel of a Column (n=1)
         or a Row (n=2) in an image.  For spectra, CRPIX1=1 typically.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>CRVALn = REAL value of user coordinates at pixel=CRPIXn.  For
         spectra, CRVAL1 = the starting wavelength (of pixel=1 typically).
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>CDELTn = REAL value scaling factor between rows (n=2) or columns
         (n=1) and user coordinates.  For spectra, CDELT1 = linear dispersion.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The X-axis label is taken from the CTYPEn card, which is a CHARACTER string
surrounded by single quote (') marks.  The Y-axis label is taken from the
BUNIT card, which is a CHARACTER string surrounded by single quote (')
marks containing the appropriate units for the "Intensity" units of the
pixels (e.g. counts/sec or flux).  These header cards may be set using the
HEDIT command.  If a particular FITS card is not found, appropriate
defaults are chosen, but be warned: older images and spectra from the Lick
Data Taking programs do not conform to the FITS standard and may give
strange results.
