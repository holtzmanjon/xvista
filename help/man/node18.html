<P>
A VISTA command is ordinarily terminated by typing a RETURN, thus limiting
the normal command length to one line of 80 characters.  However, you can
continue a command onto the next line by ending the current line of
characters with the  character.  The last non-blank character must be a
 for your command to be extended.  You will be prompted for the rest of
the command with a colon on the next line. Example:

<P>
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
There is a limit to the length of a command permitted even when using the
 character, and that limit is 500 characters.

<P>
<BR><HR>
<ADDRESS>
 
</ADDRESS>
