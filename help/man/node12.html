<P>
The default VISTA graphics device is an X11 window that will be created
automatically when the first graphics commands are used.  VISTA uses the
LickMongo package for all vector graphics (line plots, contour maps, etc.)
and PostScript hardcopy.

<P>
If you are using VISTA from a terminal that does not support X11 graphics
(e.g., from an old VT100 terminal or over a modem from a PC running a
Tektronix emulator), you can change the default terminal type used
for screen graphics using the TERM command.

<P>
Issuing TERM without an argument will print a menu and prompt the
user for the device type.

<P>
TERM is called by the VISTA program on startup and sets the default
graphics device for the session.  This may be changed at any time
during a session with the TERM command, but the default is hardwired
into the program at compile time, and any changes will be forgotten
during the next VISTA session unless you put a TERM command with
the necessary keywords in your startup procedure file.

<P>
Hardcopy devices must be changed explicitly with the HARDCOPY= keyword.  If
no command line argument is given, then the user will be allowed to change
the terminal type only.

<P>
The default Hardcopy device for VISTA is Adobe PostScript files.  All PS
output from VISTA conforms to the PostScript standard and will produce
output on any PostScript device.  Encapsulated PS output is produced by
some commands (usually via an EPS keyword), and conforms to the Adobe EPS
Level 2.0 structuring conventions.
