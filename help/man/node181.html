<P>
APER will sum the intensities of pixels falling within circular apertures
centered on an object in the 'source' image.  Using apertures of differing
radii will enable you to characterize the radial intensity distribution of
an object.

<P>
Up to 10 aperture radii in arc seconds can be specified with the RAD
keyword. Alternatively, a linearly increasing sequence of apertures can be
specified with the STEP keyword, where 'incr' is the radius increment in
arc seconds, and 'n' is the number of apertures.  A geometric sequence of
apertures can be set up with the GEO= keyword, with the first value being
the first aperture size and the second the multiplier for subsequent
apertures; as many apertures as will fit in the image will be used.  The
pixel scale in arcsec/pixel is specified with the SCALE keyword.  The
centers of the aperture must be calculated ahead of time with the AXES
centroiding command, or loaded with the C keyword. Lastly, the OLD keyword
tells the routine to use any unspecified parameters from the last time.

<P>
The routine will produce a list of the apertures, the sum of pixels
interior to them, the average interior surface brightness, and the same
quantities for the rings defined by sequential apertures. The summations
are done to the nearest pixel at the edges of the aperture, that is, no
fractional pixel interpolation is done at the edges.  For this reason,
results obtained with very small apertures may be inaccurate.  The results
are stored in a common block, and can be examined with the PRINT command,
and stored or retrieved with the GET and SAVE commands. With the PLOT
keyword, the apertures will be displayed on the image display (for most
video devices).

<P>
APER does NOT do sky subtraction.  The background light is included in the
calculation of the brightnesses.  Use SKY to compute the background of the
image, and SUBTRACT to remove that background.

<P>
Specifying a list with the MAG word will give observed magnitudes in the
listed apertures. (What does this mean??  good question!  Inspection of
code seems that MAG= keyword allows user to specify magnitude values which
just get output right back.)

<P>
The STORE keyword saves some results into VISTA variables. The total
intensity in the first aperture is loaded into variable TOTAL, the area of
the first aperture will be loaded into APAREA, and the average intensity
into variable AVERAGE.

<P>
To extract aperture photometry in elliptical apertures, see the EMAG
command.
