<BR>

<P>
OPEN attempts to do a Fortran OPEN on the specified file. Such files must
be normal sequential files as might be generated by the editor or various
commands.  If the file is successfully opened the logical_name is then
assigned to the opened file and all further references to the file are made
using the logical name. If an OPEN is done using a logical name which is
already assigned to an opened file, this old file is closed and the new
file is opened.  When a file is first opened, the first line of the file is
ready to be read.  A detailed example of how to use OPEN and the logical
file name is given in the description of the READ command. 

<P>
A maximum of up to five (5) files can be OPEN'ed at once.  See CLOSE to
close a currently open file.

\item[OPEN DATA ./mydatafile.dat\hfill]{ Opens the file for reading
and assigns it the logical name DATA.}
\end{example}">
<BR>

<P>
Note that while in Unix all file names are case sensitive, but within
VISTA the logical names assigned to them are case insensitive, thus:
<PRE>
   OPEN DATA ./myfile.dat
   OPEN data ./myfile.dat
</PRE>
are identical.
