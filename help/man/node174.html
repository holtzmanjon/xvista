EWAVE will first match emission peaks in an extracted echelle arc spectrum
(where the row number of the Vista image corresponds to the order number of
the spectrum in that row, and the column number will be the column from the
original (raw) image).  For each order, the program looks for peaks and
attempts to identify them based on an initial estimate of the central
wavelength of that order.  It assumes that none of the lines are blended.
After the identifications are made a two-D polynomial is fit using a
non-linear least square method.  The two coordinates of this polynomial are
the column number and 1/m where m is the order number.  The default orders
of the polynomial are 2 for the column number and 1 for the 1/m coordinate.
It is possible at the moment to fit a 3 x 1 polynomial instead of a 2 x 1
polynomial using PORD=3 but this generally does not improve the accuracy of
the fit.  The fit parameters are iterated up to five times.

<P>
The `XOFF=' keyword is used when the ccd is offset from the nominal pattern
center (grating rotation = 493830).  It is positive when the ccd is to the
left of the pattern center.  It is zero by default.  The keyword `REJ=' is
invoked to allow the routine to converge more rapidly.  A line is rejected
if the difference between the wavelength of the line and its wavelength
determined from the polynomial fit is larger than `rej' mA.  It is invoked
after the second iteration and is 100 mA by default.
