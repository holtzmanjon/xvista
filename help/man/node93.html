<P>
PLOT3D (also THREED or 3D) makes a 3 dimensional perspective plot of the
specified buffer. The viewing altitude and aziumuth can be specified with
the ALT= and AZ= terminal; if unspecified, they default to 45 and 225
degrees, respectively. The vertical scale is done automatically, but can be
overridden by use of the ZFAC and ZOFF keywords. See the Mongo manual for
more details. NOERASE prevents erasure of the screen before making the
plot. HARD generates hardcopy.

<P>
The 3-D plots that LickMongo makes can take a long time to draw.  Once the
plot starts, there is no way to stop it until it is completed.
Consequently, we suggest that you only use it on small sections of images,
smaller than 100 x 100 pixels. The BOX= keyword makes it easy to select
small image sections. If you enter an image larger than 100x100, the
program will confirm that you really wish to continue before doing so.

<P>
Some control over the vertical relief plotted is possible using the ZFAC
and ZOFF keywords.  These affect how the minimum and maximum data values
are fit inside the virtual cube being plotted.  By changing these by hand,
you can enhance or depress the vertical stretch of the plot (ZFAC) and move
the plot up and down vertically within the plotting window (ZOFF).

<P>
If these are too arcane for you, then SCALE can be used instead to tweak
the defaults computed by the routine from the data values, where SCALE=1 is
equivalent to accepting the defaults, SCALE1 will increase relief, and
SCALE1 will depress relief.
