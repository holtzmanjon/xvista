EXTINCT will correct a wavelength-calibrated spectrum 'source' for
atmospheric extinction.  The zenith angle is measured from the header
information, and the air mass calculated with a polynomial in secant(z) to
account for the finite thickness of the atmosphere.  A set of extinction
values is calculated at several wavelengths, and a spline drawn through
them.  The spectrum is multiplied by the spline to correct it for
extinction.

<P>
The extinction correction which is used is the average extinction for Lick
Observatory.  The keyword CTIO will have EXTINCT use values appropriate for
Cerro Tololo; KPNO uses the Kitt Peak extinction coefficients.  These are
very similar. Note that the set of coefficients used is remembered between
successive calls to EXTINCT; if you specify CTIO on one call to EXTINCT,
the CTIO coefficients will be used on all successive calls unless the
keyword LICK or KPNO is explicitly used on the command line.

<P>
The longitude and latitude of the observatory at which the data were
acquired must be defined either before running VISTA by defining the UNIX
environment variables V_LONGITUDE and V_LATITUDE, or by using the VISTA
SETUP command.  You will need to do this to obtain correct determinations of
airmass or extinction when reducing CCD images from other observatories.
The longitude and latitude must be in decimal degrees: For example
<PRE>
  SETENV V_LONGITUDE 121.64554
  SETENV V_LATITUDE 37.43029
</PRE>
Is the longitude and latitude of the Lick Observatory (Mount Hamilton, CA).

<P>
If these variables are not defined, defaults set at compile time will be
used.  You can also redefine the longitude with the SETUP command inside of
VISTA.
