<P>
SET defines VISTA variables in terms of numerical constants, other
variables, or the result of arithmetic operations between other
variables. The name of a VISTA variable is any alphanumeric string.  The
value of the variable is a floating point number. VISTA supports an
internal variable table which holds variables defined by you or as the
output of a program.  These variables can be used to pass the results of
arithmetic calculations to keywords, to control the flow of a procedure in
IF tests or DO loops, or to store convenient numbers in symbolic form.

<P>
Each SET command can handle up to 15 definitions.  Each definition must
include an '=' sign with the name of the new variable to its left, and a
defining expression to its right.  The expression on the right may be any
proper VISTA arithmetic expression (see the section MATH for rules on
expressions).

<P>
Examples:
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
NOTE: All operations are done in double precision floating point.  There
must be no spaces between the beginning of 'var_name' and the end of
'value'.

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT!</B>

<P>
The command SET may be left off when defining variables.  This saves lots
of time.  Just use an arithmetic expression defining a variable.  Examples:
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<BR><HR>
<ADDRESS>
 
</ADDRESS>
