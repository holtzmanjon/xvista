AUTOMARK finds objects on an image, storing their positions in a photometry
file.  It works this way: 

<UL>
<LI>the program first finds all local peaks in the image
   that have values between those given in RANGE.  
</LI>
<LI>at each of these peaks, it computes a centroid in a box
   of size (2 * rad - 1).  These centroids are the locations
   of the stars on the image.
</LI>
<LI>if this location falls within DMIN pixels of an already
           marked star, it is rejected. The default value for DMIN is 1.
</LI>
</UL>
REJECT is used to reject stars that are near masked pixels.  See MASK for
instructions on masking pixels. RADIUS should be set to a value that is
near the FWHM of the stars in pixels.  REJECT should be at least 3 times
RADIUS.  REJECT=0 (or REJECT not given) means that stars will be found all
over the image.  Default values are RADIUS=2 and REJECT=0.

<P>
The centroiding algorithm will recompute the centroid using a shifted
region if the last centroid falls off the middle of the centroiding
region. If it does not converge within 6 iterations, it does not mark the
object. The maximum number of iterations can be changed with the NITER=n
keyword. Also, you can force the program to find something by using the
FORCE keyword, in which case the routine will use the last centroid
computed, regardless of whether it has converged or not - be cautious with
this!

<P>
Note that this program will find high points in an image which are not
stars.  It will center on galaxies, cosmic ray hits, etc.  The program was
designed for moderately crowded images with few defects - images for which
the number of stars is much larger than the number of defects.  Use MASK to
mark cosmic ray hits, bad columns, galaxies, etc.

<P>
If no RANGE of peak values is given, the program will center on peaks with
heights between 0 and 1.0E10.  If only one value is given, it will find
peaks with values from that given upwards to 1.0E10.

<P>
AUTOMARK appends to the current photometry file, if there is one.  If the
keyword NEW is given, it creates a new list.

<P>
Object ID numbers which will be output into DAOPHOT files using the SAVE
DAO= or SAVE COO= command can be specified with the ID= or OBSNUM
keywords. Using ID=id associates the first detection with the number 'id',
then subsequent detections have 'id' incremented by one.  The observation
number (from the FITS header value OBSNUM) will be coded into the ID number
if the OBSNUM keyword is specified.

<P>
Example: 
<BR>

<BR>
A 'local peak' is defined as a pixel for which ALL 8 adjacent pixels (left,
right, top, bottom, and the 4 diagonals) have lower values.

<P>
Here is a procedure which masks pixels larger than a certain value, then
finds the stars.  This rejection of bright stars can be used to eliminate
saturated stars.  The program also masks the edge pixels so that stars too
close to the borders of the image are not found.
