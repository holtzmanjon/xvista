<P>
Starting in VISTA Version 4, the package DAOPHOT, written by Peter Stetson
(Dominion Astrophysical Observatory), has been included to facilitate image
interaction and a common file storage system. Generally, the original
DAOPHOT commands have been changed as little as possible. Consequently,
many of the fancy features of VISTA cannot be interfaced with the DAOPHOT
routines.  For example, DAOPHOT images always have origin (1,1) while VISTA
can handle arbitrary image limits. For the most part, however, the
interface is straightforward to use. All of the DAOPHOT routines which
require a file with image data in standalone DAOPHOT now require a buffer
number with the image in memory. All of the photometry output data is
stored in disk files exactly as DAOPHOT always stores it. See the DAOPHOT
manual for all the details. Not all of the DAOPHOT routines are
implemented.

<P>
We have found that interfacing DAOPHOT with VISTA is extremely convenient
because several command line interfaces were created. In many routines,
keywords have been implemented for the DAOPHOT commands that require
keyboard input, facilitating running things in procedures and batch. In
addition, a facility has been provided for providing hard wired default
file names for use with the DAOPHOT routines. If the various photometry
files (.COO, .AP, .MAG, .GRP, .NST, etc.) are previously specified with the
DAOFILES command, the DAOPHOT routines will not prompt the user for
entries, but will rather use the appropriate file as specified with the
DAOFILES command. This is immensely useful for writing VISTA procedures to
do whole chunks of the reduction process as painlessly as possible.

<P>
The version of DAOPHOT which is included in VISTA is an adaptation of
Stetson's 1987 version of the code. Subsequently, Stetson has made
modifications to the standard distribution of DAOPHOT which are NOT
included in the VISTA package. In addition, some modification of the
original DAOPHOT code was necessary to make it work inside of VISTA.
Several new options were added as well by Jon Holtzman. Because of these
facts, Stetson can NOT be help responsible for any results that come out of
the VISTA/DAOPHOT routines. From extensive use of the code, we feel the
routines are reliable, but this cannot be absolutely guaranteed. We are
very grateful to Peter Stetson for allowing us to incorporate his code.

<P>
If you wish to use a Stetson's up-to-date version of DAOPHOT, contact him
for the source code, and simply use VISTA to write out the data in some
format which the standalone DAOPHOT can read.

<P>
Any questions about the VISTA/DAOPHOT routines should be addressed to the
VISTA distributors and not to Stetson. Publications using the VISTA/DAOPHOT
routines should give credit both to VISTA and to Stetson but remember, he
cannot be help responsible for the results.

<P>
I leave the full description of all the DAOPHOT commands to the DAOPHOT
manual. Here, I summarize the available DAOPHOT commands (HELP is available
for these in a very limited way): OPTIONS, FIND, PHOTOMETRY, GROUP, PSF,
PEAK, NSTAR, SUB* MONITOR, NOMONITOR, SORT, OFFSET, SELECT, APPEND, DAOSKY,
and DUMP.
