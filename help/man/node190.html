<P>
CPROF enables the user to inspect the results of a PROFILE calculation in
graphical form, and to modify them by replacing portions judged to be in
error by the results of a second order polynomial fit to "good" regions.
This often is necessary for spiral galaxies for which the outer contours
can get confused.

<P>
The ellipticity, surface brightness, and semi-minor axis values stored in
the PROFILE common block are first plotted on the display.  Frequently one
can find regions of spuriously low ellipticity and surface brightness, with
a corresponding local maximum in the semi-minor axis, known as "excursions";
these represent areas in which the PROFILE iterations have converged
poorly. If such a region is identified, the user is asked to specify the
boundaries of regions on either side of the excursion in which the PROFILE
results are judged to be acceptable; a polynomial is fit to the
ellipticities, position angles, and surface brightnesses in the latter
regions. The results of the fit are then used to recompute ellipticities,
PA's and SB's in the excursion region. The default is to perform a second
order fit, but fits of other order can be used by giving the ORDER=n
keyword.

<P>
The process of plotting the profile parameters, identifying glitches, and
replacing with fits continues until the user specifies that the profile is
satisfactory. Another option is to fit only the surface brightnesses in a
region. This is sometimes desirable when the ellipticity undergoes an
abrupt, genuine increase; the surface brightness is then spuriously
enhanced.

<P>
CPROF is best used when the galaxy image has been displayed, and the
ellipses overplotted on the image using TVPROF. The success of a CPROF
calculation is best measured by looking at this display.
