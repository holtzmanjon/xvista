To substitute the value of a string into a command line, enclose the name
of the string in braces.  As an example, the command RD reads a file from
disk.  Its syntax is
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img68.png"
 ALT="\begin{hanging}
\item{RD buf filename}
\end{hanging}">
<BR>
which reads a disk file 'filename' into buffer number 'buf'.  Suppose the
string FNAME has been defined to be MYDIR/MYFILE.  Then
<BR>

<BR>
will execute the command
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img70.png"
 ALT="\begin{hanging}
\item{RD 2 MYDIR/MYFILE}
\end{hanging}">
<BR>

<P>
To print string variables:

<OL>
<LI>Use the command PRINT STRINGS to show all defined strings.
</LI>
<LI>Use PRINTF and substitute the string as the format string.
       Example:
<BR>
PRINTF 'STRING'
<BR>
The  and  do the string substitution.  The quotes are needed
       if the string has more than one word in it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use PRINTF with the %A format specification.  (As in FORTRAN),
       this may be followed by the number of characters to print.
       Examples:
<BR>
PRINTF 'Writing file %A' 'FNAME'
<BR>
PRINTF 'Writing file %A20 ' 'FNAME'
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The substitution mechanism can be used to copy the value of a FITS card
into a string.  The syntax for this is:

<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="\begin{hanging}
\item{\{?BUFFER:CARDNAME\}}
\end{hanging}">
<BR>

<P>
where BUFFER is an arithmetic expression which evaluates to a buffer
number, and CARDNAME is the name of a FITS card.

<P>
The value of the FITS card is substituted into the command line where
indicated by the {?BUFFER:CARDNAME} construction.  If the buffer number
is incorrect, there is nothing in the listed buffer, or if the named card
does not exist, an error message is printed and a blank string is
loaded. Leading blanks and comments are stripped off. Use the STRING
command to load a string with a FITS character card. Use a direct
assignment to load a numerical FITS card into a VISTA variable.  For
example:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img72.png"
 ALT="\begin{example}
\item[STRING OBJ '{?23:OBJECT}'\hfill]{Loads the name of the ob...
... the FOCUS
card (a number) and loads the numerical value into A.}
\end{example}">
<BR>

<P>
ADVANCED EXAMPLES:

<P>
In the examples below, the string substitution is used as part of
procedures.  See the section on procedures for more information.

<OL>
<LI>In this procedure, the user is asked to give a filename.  The file
       contains an image which is to be processed in some standard way.
       The processed image is written out with the same name.
  <PRE>
    STRING FILE '?Enter the file to process. &gt;&gt; '  ! Get filename
    RD 1 {FILE}                                    ! Read image
    CALL PROCESS                                   ! Process it
    WD 1 {FILE}                                    ! Write out
    END
</PRE>
  As the procedure is run, the prompt 'Enter ... ' appears user's screen.
  The reply is loaded into the string variable FILE.  Suppose the reply was
  ./mydir/hd183143.  The next command, which reads an image from the disk,
  uses the string substitution mechanism to insert the string FILE into the
  command.  The actual command executed is
  <BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img73.png"
 ALT="\begin{hanging}
\item {RD 1 ./mydir/hd183143}
\end{hanging}">
<BR>
Similarly, the last command in the procedure is
  <BR>

<BR>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The following loop defines the string NAME.  The value of NAME
      is successively FILE001, FILE002, FILE003, FILE004, ... FILE100
  <PRE>
    DO INDEX=1,100
       STRING NAME 'FILE%I3.3' INDEX
    END_DO
    END
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The following procedure reads an image from tape, processes it in
        some way, then writes it out to disk in a directory specified by
        the user.  The filename is FILEnnn, where nnn is the number of the
        image on tape.  Program stops when the user gives a number less
        than or zero.
  <PRE>
     STRING DIR '?Which directory will hold the images? $&gt;&gt;$ ' 
     LOOP:
        PRINTF 'Enter a number &lt;=0 to stop.'
        ASK NUM 'Process which number on tape? &gt;&gt; '
        IF NUM&lt;=0
           GOTO FINISH
        END_IF
        RT 1 $NUM
        CALL PROCESS
        STRING NAME 'FILE%I3.3' NUM
        WD 1 {DIR}{NAME}
     GOTO LOOP
     FINISH:
        PRINTF 'Done!'
     END
</PRE>
  The string substitution mechanism,  and , can also be used to
  substitute text from an OPEN'ed file.  See the discussion for the OPEN
  and READ commands for more details on using text files.
