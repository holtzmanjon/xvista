<P>
MAGAVER takes the output file from COMBINE when run with the CMB=
option. It will ask the user which columns in this file correspond to which
colors, and will do a weighted average of multiple observations in each
color. Currently, only 3 different colors are allowed.  If the PLOT keyword
is specified, the magnitudes to be averaged will be displayed with a MONGO
plot for each star. If the TTY keyword is specified, the user will be
allowed to interactively remove points from each set of observations.

<P>
This command can also be used on output photometry files to merge them
together into one file, for later use by FITSTAR.  In this mode, the
program will prompt for a file name, read the stars in from this file and
output them to a new file, then ask for a new input file, from which to
append the results onto the original output file. This can be used, for
example, to merge all observations of standard stars from multiple frames
into one file.  The NORM keyword will normalize all the measured magnitudes
to a standard exposure time, assuming the exposure is stored in the data
file.
