VISTA can store several commands in a list and execute them as a program.
A list of such commands is termed a PROCEDURE.  The list is stored in a
special buffer, called the 'procedure buffer'.

<P>
Almost any VISTA command that has proper syntax can be used in a procedure.
The basic commands for creating, storing, and modifying procedures are
these:
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
There are several 'control commands' that effect the operation of a
procedure.
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
This list serves not only as an introduction to those not familiar with
procedures, but illustrates the flexibility that procedures give to VISTA
programming.  A defined procedure eliminates the boredom of typing
repetitive commands over and over, but it does much more than that: it
greatly expands the functions of VISTA so that new applications do not
always require new subroutines.  A familiarity with procedures will make
your data reductions more efficient.

<P>
IMPORTANT:
<BR>
Do NOT put any of the flow-control statements (DO, IF, END_DO, etc.) with
other commands on a line.  They must appear separately.  Thus:
<PRE>
   DO I=1,10}
   DO J=1,10}
      (some stuff)}
   END\_DO; END\_DO
</PRE>
or similar constructions, will NOT work properly!

<P>
As the VISTA program begins, it executes the procedure stored in the file
defined by the environment variable V_STARTUP.  For example, if you had
defined V_STARTUP through
<PRE>
   setenv V_STARTUP ./myprocs/myproc.pro
</PRE>
<I>before</I> running VISTA, then myprocs/myproc.pro will be executed as the
program begins.  Typically, the startup procedure will contain definitions
of aliases, the setting of symbol values, or the reading into buffers of
repeatedly-used images.  This procedure is not saved in the procedure
buffer as it is executed.
