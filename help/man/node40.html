GO tells VISTA to start executing the procedure held in its procedure
buffer.  You may also supply parameters to the procedure on the command
line.  The parameters must be evaluated using the PARAMETER command in the
procedure.

Examples:

Earlier versions of VISTA allowed you to specify a number of times to
execute a procedure, as in 'GO 3', which executed the current procedure
three times.  This was installed in the earliest versions of VISTA, before
there were DO loops.  This feature has been deleted from the version 3.
The old version 2 form 'GO filename' has been eliminated, since this can
now be done with the CALL command.
