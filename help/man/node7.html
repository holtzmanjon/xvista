<P>
The VISTA program is generally stared with the command
<BR>

<BR>
assuming that it has been installed somewhere which is found in your
command path.

<P>
VISTA will respond with a 'welcome' message and a prompt. The welcome
message, if it is long, comes out a screen at a time.  Hit 'return' at the
end of each page to keep reading a message.  Hit anything else to go on.
The program will then give you a prompt ( GO: ). The prompt tells you that
the program is ready to execute a command. Type a command you want, and hit
RETURN.  When the command is completed, the prompt will reappear.  If you
type a command that VISTA does not recognize, it will say so.

<P>
VISTA is a rather large program, you may need access to a reasonably large
amount of physical and virtual memory.

<P>
On startup, VISTA can also be instructed to run a designated procedure.
This is a convenient feature which allows you to customize your VISTA
environment.  Use the environment variable V_STARTUP to specify the name
of the file containing the procedure you want executed as the program
begins.  Typically this procedure will define aliases or set the values of
variables.  Read the section on procedures (HELP PROCEDURE) for more
information.

<P>
Some additional symbols which also can (or need to ) be defined in
environment variables for use on startup:

<UL>
<LI>V_HELPDIR     (directory with helpfiles)
</LI>
<LI>V_LATITUDE (latitude in degrees)
</LI>
<LI>V_LONGITUDE (longitude in degrees)
</LI>
<LI>V_SYSTEM (where to find dosystem file needed to spawn UNIX commands)
</LI>
</UL>
