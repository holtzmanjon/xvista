Archaic command: see PEDIT

<P>
When this command is entered during a procedure definition it tells VISTA
to leave the procedure-definition mode and to return to the
command-execution mode.  Unlike the END command, however, the SAME command
tells VISTA to keep any lines that may have been defined after the
insertion point, that is, the commands in the buffer following the
insertion point are to be left the same as they were before.  The SAME
command makes sense only when you are modifying previously defined
procedures, and is not saved in the procedure buffer. It is also largely
historical, as it is not needed if you use the PEDIT command to modify
procedures.
