<P>
You do not need to type the full command name to execute a command - all
that is needed is the shortest unambiguous string which defines a command.
For example, the command FITSTAR can be executed with FITSTAR, FITSTA,
FITST, ... etc.  If it turns out that more than one command begins with the
command that you type, all those commands will be listed, and none
executed.

<P>
The question mark command can be used to list those commands which begin
with a certain pattern.  Type '?' followed by the pattern you are
examining.  There should be no spaces between the ? and the pattern.
Examples:

<P>
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
Keywords and command arguments CANNOT be abbreviated.

<P>
The ? operator may also be used as an abbreviation for the HELP command.
To receive help on a given topic, type ?, followed by a space, followed by
the topic about which you wan help.  Some examples:

<P>
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<BR><HR>
<ADDRESS>
 
</ADDRESS>
