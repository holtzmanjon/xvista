<P>
RENUC reconstructs a model of a multiple galaxy system or any combination
of its component galaxies from the multiple galaxy system photometry
computed by the SNUC command.

<P>
The EX keyword is used to select those galaxies NOT to be reconstructed.
Similarly, the INC keyword can be used to select only those galaxy models
to be included in the reconstruction.

<P>
If the quality of the outer isophote solutions for any galaxy is poor, they
can be ignored by the reconstruction algorithm with the LIM keyword.

<P>
CENTER tells the routine to use any isophote dependent centers for the
reconstruction that may have been measured with the CENTER option in the
SNUC command (at this time, this option does not work well).
