CONTOUR: Make Contour Maps Images
</H1>

<!-- linkto contour.html -->
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
CONTOUR produces a contour map of an image or set of images either on the
graphics terminal screen or on a hardcopy device.  Contour levels are user
specified or suitable defaults are applied.  Options for coordinate
transformations between the image pixels and real-world coordinates are
possible via a simple linear transformation matrix defined by the user.  It
is possible to overlap several images onto a single contour plot by
specifying multiple image buffers on the command line, or to plot them into
individual windows on the plot using special windowing keywords.

<P>
Setting Contour Levels:

<P>
Contour levels for the plot may specified in one of two ways.  In the
first, the levels are explicitly set by the LEVELS keyword.  Up to 40
levels may be specified in this way.  In the second method, the keyword LOW
is used to set the lowest level of the plot, and the DIFF or RATIO keywords
are used to set the other levels.  DIFF means that successive contours will
be separated by the given difference; RATIO means that successive contours
will be separated by the given ratio.

<P>
When multiple images are specified on the command line, use of these
keywords sets the contour levels for ALL of the images.  A technique for
plotting multiple contours on the screen or in hardcopy plots with
<I>different</I> contouring levels is described under Advanced Techniques
below.

<P>
The FID keyword establishes a "fiducial" contour level for the plot. All
contours above this fiducial level are plotted as normal, unbroken lines
and all contours below this level are plotted as broken lines.  The
fiducial contour itself is plotted with a heavy solid line to distinguish
it.  The default value is FID=0.0, so that all negative contours will be
dashed by default following the convention established by radio
astronomers.

<P>
If the contour levels are not specified, the program computes its own in
the following way.  If multiple images are given, the the program computes
levels for each image <I>independently</I>.

<P>
The lowest contour is the mean of the image in the area being plotted.
Subsequent contours are spaced 0.5 magnitudes (a factor of 1.583) apart, or
5 contour levels per decade of intensity.  This turns out to be a useful
default for a wide variety of astronomical applications. The mean is
computed using every fifth pixel to save time; for small images with great
variations in intensity across the image, the fifth-pixel mean will not be
a good representation of the true mean, and so the default contours may not
produce a good plot.  Use the MN command to find the true mean and set the
contours by hand.

<P>
Contour Map Scaling:

<P>
By default, CONTOUR will assume nothing about the image pixel scale, and
plot the axes of the contour map in pixel space, labeling the axes in rows
and columns with orientation matching the appearance on the color image
display.

<P>
The simplest scaling option is to specify the image pixel scale.  The SCALE
keyword sets the scale of both axes in arcsec/pixel, and sets the origin to
be the center of the portion of the image being mapped, or to the center
defined by the CEN keyword.  If SCALE is omitted, the axes are displayed in
pixel units.  The orientation of the axes is this: the units increase from
right to left on the bottom of the graph, and from bottom to top along the
left side.  This will be in the usual astronomical convention if north is
at the top of the graph and east is at the left.  Use FLIP and/or ROTATE to
get the image in this orientation.

<P>
A more sophisticated scaling option is available via the USER keyword. The
USER keyword sets the scaling and labelling of each axis independently
using the contents of the FITS header.  The axes are scaled according to:
<BR>

<BR>
X and Y axis labels are taken from the CTYPE1 and CTYPE2 cards
respectively.  Any of these FITS cards may be changed (or defined) using
the FITS or HEDIT commands.

<P>
The most general coordinate tranformation between the image's pixel grid
(Cols,Rows) and "world coordinates" (X,Y) may be performed using the "TR="
option.  This allows the user to specify a general transformation matrix
which includes possible rotation and shear terms.  The "TR=" keyword
requires 6 transformation matrix elements, given in the form:
<BR>

<BR>
where:
<BR>

<BR>
are the transformation equations.  X and Y are the "world" coordinates in
which you want the plot to appear, and C and R are the image Column and Row
numbers.

<P>
The default scaling is equivalent to:  "TR=(0.,1.,0.,0.,0.,1.)"

<P>
The SCALE=s keyword is equivalent to: "TR=(C0,s,0.0,R0,0.0,-s)" where
(C0,R0) is the image central pixel.

<P>
The USER keyword is equivalent to:
"TR=(CRVAL1-CDELT1*CRPIX1,CDELT1,0.0,CRVAL2-CDELT2*CRPIX2,0.0,CDELT2)"
where the CXXXn are the relevant FITS cards (see USER above).

<P>
Be advised that this is an option for experts.

<P>
Contour Formatting Options:

<P>
Below are a number of options for changing the appearance of the contour
lines themselves, but not affecting the actual contour levels.

<P>
EXACT tells the program to use a slower contour "following" algorithm
rather than the default "fast" raster drawing algorithm.  This will result
in somewhat rougher (though perhaps truer) contours, and it handles dashed
lines far better.  In noisy cases, use of EXACT is not advised.

<P>
DASH draws contours for all images given as dashed lines (see LTYPE= below)

<P>
LWEIGHT=w: Changes the weight (line width) of the contours to W.  For
Screen plots, W is taken to be a multiple of the default pen width.  For
PostScript hardcopy plots, W is the width of the graphics pen in units of
printers points.  Default is 1.0 for screen plots, and 0.5 for hardcopy
plots.

<P>
LTYPE=l1,l2,...: Changes the line style (solid, dashed, etc) of the
contours for a given image.  Multiple arguments are used to set different
styles for each of the images on the command line (l1 for the first image,
l2 for the second, etc).  There are 7 line styles available:

<P>
Contour Plot Axis Formatting Options:

<P>
The following keywords allow you to change the format of the axes
surrounding the contour map.

<P>
TITLE puts the object title (from the image header) over the contour map.
This can be changed using either CH or HEDIT to suit your needs.

<P>
NOLABEL draws the axes with tick marks, but does not label the axes.

<P>
NOAXES draws the axes, but does not draw ticks or labels (e.g., plain box)

<P>
NOERASE prevents erasure of the screen before beginning a plot. This may be
used to superimpose two contour plots for comparison.  NOERASE is ignored
for hardcopy, but there are comparable tricks for overplotting different
contours with different levels discussed under Advanced Techniques below.

<P>
Large Size and Multi-Window Contour Plots:

<P>
The following command can be used to change the position and size of the
contour plots on the graphics area.  By default, a single contour axis
window is drawn, with scaling set so as to draw the largest window on the
screen (or paper) as possible and still preserve a 1:1 aspect ratio between
the X and Y axes (e.g., it assumes square image pixels).

<P>
FULL draws a single plot, but without preserving a 1:1 aspect ratio.  This
keyword is useful for plotting contours of long-slit spectra, for example.

<P>
NH=h, NV=v: These two keywords allow the user to divide the plotting area
in to HxV windows, each of which can take a separate contour plot.  The
window convention is the same as used in the LickMongo package.  For
example: "NH=2 NV=2" will divide the screen/paper in to 4 windows, 2x2 on
the page.

<P>
NW=n (Single Image Contour Plotting Only): This keyword tells the contour
program to put the current image into window number N, where windows are
number in LickMongo fashion running left-to-right, and bottom-to-top
starting in the lower left-hand corner of the graphics screen/page.  This
keyword is only acknowledged if ONE image was given on the command line.
To build up a multi-window plot with NW=, use the NOERASE or NOPRINT
keywords (for screen &amp; hardcopy respectively - see Advanced Techniqes
below)

<P>
SUBMAR=sx,sy: By default, the windows specified with NH= and NV= have
margins of white space between them to accommodate axis labels, numbers,
titles, etc.  The amount of margin allowed is fixed automatically by the
LickMongo plotting package, but the user can choose the margins with the
SUBMAR command.  This works the same as the LickMongo "SUBMARGINS"
command/subroutine.  SX and SY are scaling factors of the default margin,
thus SUBMAR=1,1 is the default state.

<P>
SUBMAR=0,0 will make the windows but together, with no margin between the
axes.  Thus one can make a continuous grid of windows using this keyword.
For example, a 2x3 grid of 9 windows with no independent axes would be
drawn using: "NH=2 NV=3 SUMBAR=0,0 NOLABEL" Where the NOLABEL keyword
suppresses all axis labels, but draws tick marks.  Ticks could be
suppressed by invoking "NOAXES" in place of "NOLABEL"

<P>
When multiple images have been specified on the command line, using the NH=
and NV= keywords (without NW=) will have the following effects:

<OL>
<LI>If the number of images equals the number of windows (N=NH*NV),
   then the first image will go in window 1, the second in window 2, and so
   forth.  Remember that window 1 is in the lower LEFT corner, not the
   upper left as with the Mongo WINDOW command.  The NW= keyword is ignored
   All contours will have the same levels.  To have different levels is a
   bit tricker, see Advanced Techniques below.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the number of images is less than the number of windows, then a
  warning to that effect is issued for your information, and the windows
  are filled up until there are no more images.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If there are more images than windows, an error message is issued.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Contour Map Hardcopy:

<P>
The LickMongo plotting routines support a wide number of hardcopy devices.
The default hardcopy device for your VISTA installation is indicated at
startup, and may be changed (as appropriate) using the TERM command.  At
most installations, this will be a PostScript laser printer (like the Apple
LaserWriter).

<P>
HARD instructs the program to draw the contour map on a hardcopy device
instead of on the graphics screen.  No plot appears on the terminal.  If
used by itself without either the NOPRINT or FILE= keywords, the hardcopy
plot will be directed to the default printer upon completion of the plot
and no "plotting file" will be retained on disk.

<P>
The following keywords ONLY work when used in conjunction with the HARD
keyword:

<P>
LAND creates a hardcopy plot oriented in "Landscape" mode (X-axis along the
long-axis of the paper).  By default, contour plot hardcopy are given the
"Portrait" orientation.

<P>
FILE=psfile: By default, HARD alone creates a scratch plotting file in a
scratch disk area, and then deletes this file as soon as it is printed.
Since PostScript files might be useful for embedding contour map figures in
LaTeX or other wordprocessing program, or to send a contour map to others
via email, this keyword creates a PostScript file named "psfile" in the
user's current working directory.  When the plot is completed, if the
NOPRINT keyword is not given, the PostScript file will be closed and ready
for printing.  If NOPRINT is given, the PostScript file is not closed.

<P>
NOPRINT suppresses closing and printing of the hardcopy file.  This allows
the user to append successive plots the hardcopy file to facilitate
building up a composite contour map (for example: multiple contour plots,
with a different contour level set in each window).  NOPRINT is the
hardcopy equivalent of the NOERASE keyword.

<P>
Advanced Techniques:

<P>
There are two main motivations behind the redesign of CONTOUR.  The first
is to allow users to overlay 2 or more contour maps on each other in both
screen and hardcopy mode.  The second is to allow the user to make a
multi-window plot in which each image is in a separate window.  Limitations
on the VISTA command-line make it difficult to give each image in the
keyword list a different set of contour levels.  Thus, when multiple images
are plotted (either in overlay or multi-window modes), all images are given
the same contour levels.  To plot images with different contour levels
requires that CONTOUR be executed multiple times.

<P>
For screen plots, this is straightforward.  The first contour is plotted
using the CONTOUR program with only one image specified.  This erases the
screen and draws the axes and contours.  Then for each subsequent image,
CONTOUR is called with the NOERASE keyword so the previous contour map is
not erased from the screen.  If a multi-window plot is being generated, the
NW= keyword is used to make the next window on the screen.

<P>
For hardcopy, things are a bit trickier, requiring different actions for
the first, middle, and last plots.  The first plot is made using the
keywords HARD NOPRINT FILE=psfile, which opens and initializes the
PostScript file name "psfile" in the current working directory.  Subsequent
plots, EXCEPT THE LAST PLOT, are also made using the same HARD NOPRINT
FILE=psfile keywords.  For the LAST plot, only "HARD FILE=psfile" is
issued, so that when the last plot is finished, the PostScript file
"psfile" is closed and now ready to be printed at the user's leisure by
hand.

<P>
An example is a 2x3 (HxV) 6-panel contour plot, in which each of the 6
images uses a different contour scaling.  We want to make a PostScript file
named "montage.ps" to contain the figure, so we can print it again later
without having to regenerate it with CONTOUR each time (e.g., for a figure
for a journal article).  The images are in buffers 1-6.  We want no axis
labels or ticks, and for there be to be no white space between the plots.
We also want the images to be oriented on the page so that the 3 vertical
rows of 2 windows will be along the long-axis of the paper ("Portrait
mode").  It would go like this:

<P>
<PRE> 
   CONTOUR 1 NH=2 NV=3 SUBMAR=0,0 HARD NOAXES FILE=montage.ps |
        LOW=10 DIFF=20 NW=1 NOPRINT
   CONTOUR 2 NH=2 NV=3 SUBMAR=0,0 HARD NOAXES FILE=montage.ps |
        LOW=3.5 DIFF=10 NW=2 NOPRINT
   CONTOUR 3 NH=2 NV=3 SUBMAR=0,0 HARD NOAXES FILE=montage.ps |
        LOW=1. RATIO=1.5 NW=3 NOPRINT
   CONTOUR 4 NH=2 NV=3 SUBMAR=0,0 HARD NOAXES FILE=montage.ps |
        LEVELS=(.01,.02,.03,.05,.07,.1,.2,.3,.5,.7,.9) NW=4 NOPRINT
   CONTOUR 5 NH=2 NV=3 SUBMAR=0,0 HARD NOAXES FILE=montage.ps |
        LOW=22 RATIO=1.583 NW=5 NOPRINT
   CONTOUR 6 NH=2 NV=3 SUBMAR=0,0 HARD NOAXES FILE=montage.ps |
        LEVELS=(10,20,100,1000,10000) NW=6
</PRE> 
Notice that the last invocation of CONTOUR dropped the NOPRINT keyword.
Also notice that the sequence of CONTOUR calls was uninterrupted.  This
avoids the possibility that another graphics call will intervene, causing
VISTA to forget that the file "montage.ps" is already opened and
initialized.

<P>
This same sequence of commands, without the "HARD FILE=montage.ps" keyword
and using NOERASE for "CONTOUR 2 ..." through "CONTOUR 6 ..." will allow
you to "preview" this hardcopy plot on the screen before making the file.
