<BR>
These commands perform all arithmetic between images and spectra.  There
are three ways to use these commands.

<P>
<B>Operations between two images or two spectra:</B>

<P>
In this form, the command word is followed by the numbers of the buffers
holding the images.  Examples are
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img205.png"
 ALT="\begin{example}
\item[ADD 1 2\hfill]{Add image in buffer 2 to image in buffer 1...
...ACT 3 4\hfill]{Subtract image in buffer 4 from image in buffer 3.}
\end{example}">
<BR>
Note that the first buffer listed is the one modified by the operation.

<P>
The FLAT word is used in the DIVIDE command to re-scale the division by the
mean of the second image, thus preserving the mean of the first buffer.
This is typically used when dividing raw images by a flat field.
<B>NOTE:</B> The mean of the second image must have previously been
calculated by the MN command!

<P>
<B>Operations between images and constants:</B>

<P>
In this form, there is only one buffer specification on the command line.
The word CONST= (or C=) is used to specify the constant to be used.
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<B>Combined image and constant operations:</B>

<P>
The first two forms of these commands may be combined, thus allowing you to
simultaneously operate on two images and a constant.
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<B>Remarks:</B>

<P>
In two-image arithmetic, only those pixels common to the two images are
changed by the operation.  The size of the destination image is not changed
by the operation.  The DR= and DC= keywords only apply to two-image
arithmetic and specify row and column offsets between the two images.  The
sense of the shift is shown in the following example: dest(C+DC,R+DR) =
dest(C+DC,R+DR) + other(C,R).

<P>
BOX limits the operation to those pixels in the destination image which are
in the specified box.
