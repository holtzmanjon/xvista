<P>
FITSTAR determines extinction and/or transformation coefficients given
observations of standard stars along with known standard magnitudes and
colors for these stars. Currently, up to five terms are available for the
full transformation equation for each color: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>first order extinction
</LI>
<LI>second order extinction
</LI>
<LI>color transformation
</LI>
<LI>time term (by Julian date)
</LI>
<LI>constant term
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
FITSTAR will by default perform a fit without a second order term or a time
term. Residuals will be displayed as a function of airmass, color,
color*airmass, and Julian date; note that these are residuals after the
best fit has been subtracted. The user then has the option of deleting
individual points from the fit, and also of allowing for a second order or
time term, or locking the value of any of the terms at any desired
value. This is accomplished generally by allowing the user to lock any of
the five parameters. Thus, transformations for extinction or color terms
alone are easily obtainable. After allowing for the addition or deletion of
new parameters and the possible deletion of bad points, a final plot of the
residuals of the fit is made as a function of standard magnitude.

<P>
Two input files are required for FITSTAR. The first is a file of standard
magnitudes and colors. The format is a header line with the number of
colors and the color names, followed by a line for each star with the
appropriate standard magnitudes.  The magnitudes should be followed by an
exclamation mark (!)  and an optional star ID and star name. If a star ID
number is given after the !, all observations with this ID number are
assumed to be observations of this standard star. If no number is given,
the user will be prompted to enter the data ID number for each standard
star. IMPORTANT: all standard star numbers should have values less than
1000. This allows use of the OBSNUM option, in which the observed star
numbers have ID = 1000*STANDARD ID + OBSNUM, allowing multiple observations
of the same star to have unique ID numbers. By default, VISTA will
recognize this convention; if you do not wish to use this convention and
also want to have star numbers greater than 1000, use the NOOBSNUM
keyword. The OBSNUM=n keyword allows the user to change the default
switch-over point from 1000 to another value. The OBSNUM2=n allows a
similar function, but with a reversed definition: ID = n*OBSNUM + STANDARD
ID

<P>
By default, the program will search the VISTA default DATA directory for
the standards file.  The standards file can be specified on the command
line with the STN=file keyword.

<P>
The second file which is required is one which contains the measured 
instrumental magnitudes, airmasses, etc.
All observations should be combined into one .mag file, using the MAGAVER
command, before running FITSTAR. It is assumed that all observations of a
given star will have the same ID number.  The program first searches the
VISTA default PHOTOMETRY directory for this data file. The data file can be
specified on the command line with the DAT=file keyword. Note that the .mag
file contains airmasses for your observations; to get good solutions, these
airmasses must be correct! For default xvista behavior, airmasses are
computed from the coordinates and time of observation, which requires that
the longitude and latitude be known. See the SETUP command for how to
modify these and/or check the computed values against precomputed values 
which may exist in the image headers. Airmasses are loaded for stellar
photometry files when the MARKSTAR or AUTOMARK command is used.

<P>
The specific transformation equation(s) that will be determined
has the form: 
<PRE>
   mag(corrected) = mag(raw) + z(1)*(airmass-air0)
                             + z(2)*(airmass-air0)*(color-col0)
                             + z(3)*(color-col0)
                             + z(4)*(hjd-hjd0)
                             + z(5)
</PRE>
where FITSTAR solves for some or all of the Z coefficients. The airmass,
color, and Julian date offsets can be specified using the AIR=, COL=, and
HJD= keywords, otherwise they default to 0, except for the HJD parameter
which defaults to the midpoint of the observations.  It can be useful to
set these values to values that fall in the mid-range of your observed
values to prevent fits for one coefficient having undue leverage on the
fits for the other coefficients. Many people like to refer their airmasses
to AIR=1.  If you use the Julian date term, you almost certainly want to
set HJD0 to fall in the middle of your observed Julian dates (note that for
this routine, Julian date actually means Julian date - 2444000). Generally,
however, the defaults work just fine.

<P>
FITSTAR will write an output file with default extension (.trn).  You can
override this default file name with the OUT=file keyword.  This file will
contain one header line which labels the columns, then a line for each
transformation equation that you have determined. Note that each run of
FITSTAR will add one line to the (.trn) file.  On subsequent runs, if you
specify the same (.trn) output file, the new transformation equations will
be appended to the old file.  You can force a new file to be opened by
using the NEW keyword. Each line in this file will contain 8 numbers and 2
character strings with the transformation info: z(1) z(2) z(3) z(4) z(5)
air0 col0 hjd0 magname colname (see the equation above for the description
of these terms).  This file will be used by the CORRECT command to correct
stellar magnitudes or PROFILE photometry.

<P>
Normally, FITSTAR runs in an interactive mode to allow you to delete stars
and/or lock parameters. It can be run in "batch" mode, however, if you
specify the BATCH keyword, then all points will automatically be
accepted. You can lock parameters on the command line using the
LOCK=n[,val] keyword. If the first argument is greater than 0, then that
parameter is locked to the valued of the second argument, or to 0 if no
second argument is given.  If the first argument is negative, then that
parameter is unlocked.  The standard magnitude and color columns to use can
be specified on the command line using the SCOL=mag,col1,col2 keyword,
where the 3 values are the same numbers that would have been entered
interactively.

<P>
Hardcopy options are available with the HARD, HARD=, and PS= keywords. With
the HARD copy, both plots will automatically be sent to the printer after
you're finished deleting stars and changing parameters. With HARD=n, where
n=1 or 2, you can just have one of the two plots sent to the printer. IF
the PS=file option is given, the plots will be written to the specified
file instead of to the printer; with this option, the first plot will have
the character 'a' appended to the specified name, and the second will have
the character 'b' appended.

<P>
The output plots can be labeled using the TITLE or TITLE= keyword; the
former will prompt the user for a title string.

<P>
The NOPLOT option can be used to suppress the making of plots entirely,
useful e.g. if you're not on a graphics terminal.

<P>
The RES and RES= keywords can be used to output individual star residuals,
along with the input data information and the standard magnitude and color
to an output file.

<P>
The STNERR=x keyword can be used to assign a single error to be used to for
all of the STANDARD magnitudes if desired. (The observed errors are taken
from the input data file). The default for STNERR is to assume standards
are all very accurate, with STNERR=0.001. This parameter will really only
affect the determined value of CHI2.

<P>
Finally, the APCOR=x keyword can be used to apply a single aperture
correction in magnitudes to apply to all of the input data; the default is
not to apply an aperture correction. If you use APCOR, the value you use
will be printed on the summary output page. In addition, solely for output
purposes, you can specify the aperture used with the AP= keyword; this will
just be echoed on the output summary page.
