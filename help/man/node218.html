MARKSTAR creates a 'photometry file', which is a record of the positions,
coordinates, and magnitudes of stars on an image.  (See HELP PHOTOMETRY for
a complete list of entries in the photometry file).  Typing 'NEW' starts a
new list.  If you don't type 'NEW', any stars you mark will be appended to
the current list (if there is one); in this case the program will show the
positions on the TV of the stars that have already been marked - after
this marking the program will be ready for you to enter new stars.  Thus
MARKSTAR with no options will show the positions of the stars in the
current photometry file.

<P>
There are two ways to operate this program.  The first mode lets you
interactively mark the positions of the stars.  The only keywords you need
in this mode are NEW and RADIUS=.

<OL>
<LI>Load an image into the display with the TV command.
</LI>
<LI>Type MARKSTAR or MARKSTAR NEW (with a RADIUS specifier).
</LI>
<LI>Move the cursor near a star.
</LI>
<LI>Hit 'C' or 'J' to mark the star.
    The 'J' key defines the star's position to be exactly
    the location of the cursor.  The 'C' computes
    an exact position by finding the centroid of the
    stellar image.  You will probably use the 'C' key
    most of the time.  The 'J' key can be used in very
    crowded fields.  
</LI>
<LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all the desired stars are found.
    At any time you may type 'H' to get a list
    of the commands for this program.
</LI>
<LI>Hit 'E' when you are finished.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
In interactive mode, the key # will display the number in the photometry
list of the star nearest the current location of the cursor, and print the
row and column location of that star.  This, combined with the STAR=
keyword (below) allows you to go back and forth between a list of star
positions and a TV image.

<P>
The second mode is to have the program mark all the stars that are on an
already-present photometry file.  This saves you time when you have several
exposures of the same field (say in several colors).  The syntax for the
second mode is MARKSTAR AUTO with the other options.  The program takes
each position on the current photometry photometry file, then looks at the
current TV image for a star.  If the star is found, the information is
stored on a new photometry list, REPLACING the old list.  (Save the old one
first!) If the stars on the new image are not exactly in the same positions
as on the old image, use DR and DC to specify the change that must be
applied to the old coordinates to match the new ones.  When the program is
finished marking the stars in this automatic mode, it switches to the
interactive mode, allowing you to mark more stars.  NOBOX prevents display
of the newly-marked stars. For images that are not just shifted, but also
rotated, you can specify the angle and center of rotation with the ANGLE,
AR=, and AC= keywords.

<P>
Use RSHIFT and CSHIFT to reject stars for which the AUTO marking gives a
new position far from the old one.  As MARKSTAR AUTO runs, it prints on the
screen the difference in position of stars on the new frame compared to the
EXPECTED positions on that frame.  This output may be redirected.

<P>
Do not confuse MARKSTAR AUTO with AUTOMARK.  AUTOMARK automatically finds
stars on a frame by locating peaks.  MARKSTAR AUTO finds stars on a frame
by referring to a photometry file.

<P>
The RADIUS specifier gives the size of the region used in computing the
centroid of the star.  It should be something like the FWHM of the star in
pixels.

<P>
The STAR= word is used to identify individual stars in a photometry file.
It draws a box around the stars whose numbers are given as arguments to
STAR=, then exits the program.  The word STAR= can appear more than once on
the command line.

<P>

<P>
You can print the contents of a photometry file with the PRINT command.
Type 'PRINT PHOT' to see the results on your terminal; type 'PRINT PHOT
HARD' to send them to the lineprinter.

<P>
It is best to create a new photometry file for each image you reduce.  That
way there is a one-to-one match between images and files.  You do not have
to include all the stars in a frame in a photometry file, if you do not so
desire, but you are asking for trouble if you have information from several
frames in the same file.

<P>
The variables R and C are loaded with the position of the last star marked.

<P>
MARKSTAR AUTO is most useful to mark a series of images that are very
similar - say exposures of the same duration and in the same color.
Images of different duration, or images in different colors will reach to
different magnitudes.  In this case AUTOMARK applied to each frame may be
the best.

<P>
To find the coordinate offset between different frames, use MARKSTAR on one
frame to locate a few bright, uncrowded stars.  Then use MARKSTAR AUTO on
the second frame.  The program will print the difference in location
between the star on the second frame and that on the first, then print the
average row and column shift.  These differences are in the sense: 
<PRE>
   SHIFT = (new position) - (old position)
</PRE>
So the shift would be applied to the first image to bring them into
alignment.
