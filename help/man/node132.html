MEDIAN loads the 'dest' buffer with the median of images im1, im2, im3, ...
Each pixel in the destination image is the median of the corresponding
pixels in the input images. Normally, the program scales each image to have
the same mean before computing the median of the stack. If you wish to do
the background determination and scaling yourself, you can suppress the
auto-rescaling by using the NOMEAN keyword.

<P>
Note that all input images must be in VISTA buffers. This prevents
computing the median of very large numbers of images because of insufficient memory.  For
this purpose, try the command BIGMEDIAN, which will median input disk FITS
files and store the median in a VISTA buffer.

<P>
At least 3 input images must be given.  None of the images can be in the
same buffer as the output image.  All the images must have the same size
and starting pixel.

<P>
The program is useful for removing cosmic-ray hits from many exposures of
the same object.  Make sure the location of the objects on the image
(stars, location of spectrum, etc) are the SAME on ALL images!  Use SHIFT
or ALIGN to align images before using MEDIAN.
