<P>
EXTRACT is an "optimal extraction" routine for extracting the spectra of
1-dimensional sources (point-sources) from 2-D spectral images.  It is
based on the algorithm described by Keith Horne (``An Optimal Extraction
Algorithm for CCD Spectroscopy'', 1986, PASP, 98, 609).  In brief, each
pixel in the spectral extraction is weighted according to the fraction of
the flux which is expected in that pixel assuming a uniform spatial
profile.  The weighting scheme is optimized to retrieve the maximum
signal-to-noise without biasing the resulting fluxes. 

<P>
EXTRACT operates much like MASH, and should result in better
signal-to-noise in those cases where the noise in the spectrum is dominated
by the background (either from the sky or from the detector read-out
noise).  

<P>
WARNING: It is inappropriate to use EXTRACT for moderate or bright objects
in which the noise is dominated by the Poisson statistics of the object
itself.  In such cases the extraction routine may discard so many points
from the spatial profile fits it does that parts of the spectrum can become
meaningless.  It is also inappropriate to use EXTRACT for objects whose
spectra are dominated by bright, unresolved emission lines (as EXTRACT
might reject them as being ``cosmic rays''), and for extended sources.  For
bright sources, emission-line objects, and extended sources, use MASH or
SPECTROID as appropriate.

<P>
The steps which EXTRACT goes through are as follows:

<OL>
<LI>The detector characteristics are specified.  These are the readout
     noise in electrons (which can be changed using the keyword RONOISE=
     from its default value of 7) and the inverse gain in electrons per DN
     (using EPERDN= to change this from the default of 2.5).  Usually the
     user will not wish to change these values, as the defaults are
     appropriate for the T.I. CCDs at Lick.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The background rows are fitted with polynomials of order "pord."
     (Use the keyword SORDER= to change this from its default value of 2.)
     The expected uncertainties in this fit are then calculated (using the
     read-out noise and the gain) and any points more than 4-sigma from the
     fit are ignored and the fit recalculated.  This fit iteration is
     performed until no new points are ignored or until 5 iterations have
     been done.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The object profile is then parameterized and fit with a polynomial
     of order 2 (unless the PORDER= keyword has been used).  Again, the fit
     is iterated a maximum of 8 times, using a rejection threshold of
     4-sigma.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Using the resulting parameterization the weights are calculated for
     each pixel and the spectrum extracted.  An automatic point rejection
     is performed at this stage to remove bad pixels on the spectrum rows
     themselves.  A more conservative 5-sigma rejection level is used and
     only one point (the one with the largest difference) is removed at
     each iteration.  A maximum of five iterations is allowed (hence up to
     five points may be removed at each wavelength).  The resulting
     spectrum is placed into the specified buffer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the SKY= and/or VAR= keywords have been specified then the
     appropriate buffers are loaded with the requested spectra.  If the SUB
     keyword has been specified then the fitted background rows are
     subtracted from the original image.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Note that the uncertainties at all stages are estimated using the assumed
detector characteristics.  When the data are of sufficient quality this
means that the uncertainties in the fits will be so small that the
inability of the fit parameterizations (both sky and profile) to accurately
model the data will be detectable.  The program will then start rejecting
large numbers of points because the model assumed is not quite appropriate.
In this case the MASH command should be used, as the data are probably of
such high signal-to-noise that the optimal extraction routine will not gain
anything over a simple summation.  The interested user is referred to
Keith's article for more details.
