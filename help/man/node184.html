<P>
EGAL is used to reconstruct a galaxy image from the high-resolution profile
generated with the PROFILE command.  The reconstructed galaxy will be
smoothed along isophotes and can be used as an ideal model for comparison
to the original.  The reconstruction preserves high spatial frequencies in
the center.  

<P>
It is possible to change the center of the reconstructed model galaxy to
any fractional pixel location with the CR and CC keywords.  

<P>
Noise in the outer contours may be suppressed with the AVANG keyword, which
azimuthally averages isophotes.  

<P>
By the default, the outer contours are replaced with an r1/4 fit to
suppress noise.  This feature can be defeated with the NODEV keyword.  This
command can be called at any time provided a profile has been calculated
with PROFILE or loaded from a disk file with the GET command.
