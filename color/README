This is a micro-attempt to describe where all these colormap files originated.
===============================================================================
The following files were a part of the Lick Vista Version 3 color directory
on the VMS systems.  This directory listing gives some idea when they were
created.  Note that this shows them in the .CLR form, which was the only
format stored on the VMS systems.  Most of these were designed for old-style
frame buffers which displayed a single image at a time.  Accordingly, they
have 256 entries.  Often the first and last colors are unusual in expectation
that the cursor will be using those colors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The colormaps "COLOR" and "CONTOUR" existed from early 8-bit framebuffer days
on the data-acquisition systems on Mt. Hamilton.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The colormap "MONGO" was generated on-the-fly by an algorithm in the Mongo
display driver for the AED512.  Comments in the code imply that it was
"taken from" Wilson A. Hoffman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anybody else knowing the history of these colormaps is welcome to tell it.
