goodness of fit  --> star rejection

distortion, incl convergence criteria

implement various locking options (stellar intensities, star+sn positions)?

determine better zeropoint guesses using locked intensities?
save full parameter structures will ability to restart

using tsField calibration

figure out how to do transformation for SN (need matching color)
