FFT generates the 1D or 2D direct fourier transform of a real image. If the
keyword ONEDIM is specified, an independent 1D direct fourier transform
will be generated for each row of the source image. For one-row images
(spectra) ONEDIM is the default.

<P>
The FFT basic routine works on data arrays whose size is an integer power
of two. If the number of columns of the original image is not an integer
power of two, the data is padded with zeros to the next power of two before
transforming. In the case of 2D transforms, also the rows will be
zero-padded to the next integer power of two.

<P>
No filtering of any kind (like the popular cosine-bell) is applied before
transforming (the user can create its own filters). It is up to the user to
manipulate the data before the FFT.

<P>
The output image is a complex image, that is to say that the real and
imaginary parts of each fourier frequency are stored in consecutive
columns. The number of columns in the transform (output image) is one more
than the power of two closest, but larger or equal, to the number of
columns in the original image. In the case of a 2D transform, the number of
rows is the a power of two closer, but larger equal, to the number of rows
in the original image. This image size accommodates all of the independent
fourier frequencies to reconstruct the original image.

<P>
BE AWARE that most VISTA commands treat complex images as real images
(except for commands FFT IFFT POWERS CMPLX CABS CMUL CDIV CONJ), some
operations on the transform-image can make it loose its meaning as ;SPMquot;a
fourier transform of a real image;SPMquot; (things like rotations, column flips,
and boxing are particular dangerous). VISTA provides basic complex
arithmetic (CMUL, CDIV, CABS, etc) that can be safely used in fourier
images. If you want to make extensive manipulations of fourier transforms,
it may be safe to separate first the real and imaginary parts (with VISTA
commands REAL and IMAG), and perform identical operation on both parts
before recombining them again into a complex image (See command CMPLX).

<P>
Convolution and deconvolution in fourier space can be perform with the help
of complex arithmetic commands CMUL and CDIV. Estimations of the power
spectrum from fourier images can be made with command POWERS or by
squaring the modulus of the transform (command CABS).
