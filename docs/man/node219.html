APERSTAR estimates the brightness of each star on a photometry file using
aperture photometry.  The brightness is the sum of the counts within a
specified radius around each star, with the sky estimated by the mean level
of counts in an annulus around the stars. APERSTAR performs the same task
as the DAOPHOT

routine, 
but the latter probably does a better
job and is recommended for most occasions.

<P>
There are three steps to measuring stellar brightnesses using
APERSTAR. First locate the stars you want to be measured using AUTOMARK or
MARKSTAR.  Then measure the brightness using APERSTAR.  Finally, save the
results to disk using SAVE PHOT or print then using the command PRINT PHOT.

<P>
You MUST specify the radius of a stellar aperture, and the radii of an
annulus used to estimate the sky.  The inner radius of the sky annulus must
be larger than the radius of the star aperture. The sky radii must differ
by at least 2.  Exception: if you give the word SKY=NONE, the sky value is
assumed to be 0.0.  This allows you to determine the sky value globally for
the image (using the SKY program), then having all stars measured with the
same sky level. If SKY=NONE is not given, the sky level is estimated for
each star.

<P>
The algorithm for determining the sky level works like this: The MEAN and
standard deviation of the intensities is measured in a first pass. Those
pixels which differ from the mean by four times the standard deviation are
then excluded from the list, and the mean level computed again.  This mean
is taken as the sky brightness.  The brightness of the star is then the sum
of (pixel - sky) for all pixels in the star's aperture.  The rejection
level can be changed from 4-sigma to a user specified value using
REJECT=sig, which gives the number of sigma objects to reject.

<P>
A similar program is APER, which measures the brightness of an single
object using a series of apertures.  Also see PROFILE or PRAD, which
measure the radial profile of objects on a frame.
