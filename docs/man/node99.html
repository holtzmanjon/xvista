<P>
MASK tells VISTA programs to ignore the specified pixels when doing
computations.

<P>
The command UNMASK is the opposite of MASK; it tells the programs to stop
ignoring the specified pixels.  UNMASK can be used without options to
unmask all pixels.

<P>
You can type UNMASK without any options to tell the routines to use all the
pixels.  Remember that rows and columns are often numbered from ZERO.  The
row or column numbers specified in MASK are the same as those given by the
'D' option in the ITV command, but remember that if the TV image is
compressed, the 'D' option will not give the exact location of certain
features in the image.  Use the BOX option in the TV command to show
smaller sections of an image when finding features you want to mask.

<P>
The mask may be saved on the disk with SAVE, and retrieved later with GET.

<P>
Not all VISTA commands recognize masked pixels.  The ones that do are: ABX,
AUTOMARK, MN, CROSS, INTERP, MASH, and SURFACE.
