<P>
You may execute most operating system shell commands directly from within
VISTA by prefixing them with a '$' sign.  These commands can also be
included as part of a procedure.

<P>
If the command line is '$' only, you go into command mode and stay there
until you type 'exit'.  It is dangerous to run large programs while you are
in this mode.

<P>
