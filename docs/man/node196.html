<P>
OPREP opens a ;SPMquot;batch photometry preparation file;SPMquot; used for batch-type
surface photometry reductions.  The files contain the following information
(one record per image):

<UL>
<LI><#7093#>SKY value<#7093#>
</LI>
<LI><#7094#>RMAX variable (max. radius for photometry)<#7094#>
</LI>
<LI><#7095#>estimated HWHM for the PSF<#7095#>
</LI>
<LI><#7096#>contents of the AXES block<#7096#>
</LI>
<LI><#7097#>image header.<#7097#>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This information is written by WPREP command, and read by RPREP.  This
routine initialized the PREPCON common block, which records the status of
the prep-file (whether open to read or write).  The filename is supplied as
a keyword.  Default directory is V_DATADIR, with the default extension
``.pre''.  If no name is given on the command line, the default name
PREPFILE is used.  If there is a prep-file already open, this routine closes
it and opens a new one.

<P>
NOTE: You must compute the image parameters above ahead of time, either
outside of VISTA or using the AXES command without the CORR option.
