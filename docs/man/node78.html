<P>
The STAT command can be used to determine information about the data values
in an ASCII file.  For the MAX and MIN functions, the given expression is
evaluated for each line in the file.  For the FIRST function, the
expression is evaluated for the first line in the file and for the LAST
function the expression is evaluated for the last line in the file.  The
COUNT function merely counts the lines in the file. Remember that SKIP'ed
lines (see the SKIP command) are never included in the calculations.  These
STAT functions are not the same as the normal VISTA math functions and can
not be included in other mathematical expressions.

<P>
The LOAD function allows the user to load data from an input ASCII file
into a VISTA image buffer. Arithmetic operations may be performed on the
input data before loading into the buffer. Simply specify the desired
buffer and the arithmetic expression to load. The new buffer will
automatically be created.
