The VISTA program was originally designed to reduce data produced by
astronomical CCD imagers, but has found use for the analysis of any digital
imaging array data, including astronomical IR Arrays, Radio Maps, and X-Ray
images.  Any image array is referred to generically as an ``IMAGE'' in
VISTA.  An image is a 2-D array of floating-point numbers that represent
the data value at a given picture-element or ``pixel'' in the image plane.
The general term for manipulation of these numbers is <I>image
processing</I>.  VISTA provides the user with a set of interactive commands
issued either at the keyboard or from a list of commands called a
<I>procedure script</I> that can be executed like a mini program in
written in the VISTA interactive command language.  In practice, VISTA can
be used to process any digital images, not just astronomical images,
although many of the routines in VISTA are specialized for astronomical
data analysis (e.g., spectrophotometry or stellar photometry).

<P>
A digital image, whatever the source, is coded as a a rectangular array of
'picture elements' or <I>pixels</I>.  Each pixel has both a location and
a value; it is the array of values that constitutes an image.  The location
of a pixel is specified by its <I>row</I> and <I>column</I>
coordinates.  Rows and columns are numbered continuously from some starting
value, usually zero or one. (Thus an image with 400 rows and 350 columns
may have the rows numbered from 1 to 399 and the columns numbered from 1 to
349).  The starting row or column may start at some other value, for
example, the numbering may run from 100 to 499.  When an image is
displayed, a convention is adopted for how rows and columns run; generally
columns increase from left to right, but various packages differ in how
they display rows.  By default, the VISTA convention is for the origin to
refer to the displayed <I>upper left</I> corner of the image; you can use
the FLIP keyword with the TV command to have the origin fall in the lower
left. Neither way guarantees that your image will appear in ``sky
orientation''; this depends on the optics in the system and the way that
the CCD is read out at the telescope.

<P>
It is convenient to refer to images by a label or name, rather than having
to refer to each of the pixels individually.  For this reason, the VISTA
program has several <I>buffers</I> (reserved blocks of memory) for the
storage of images.  VISTA allows the use of up to one hundred image
buffers, although the actual number of buffers that may be filled at any
given time depends on the sizes of the images and the amount of memory
available on your system.  An image is referred to by the number of the
buffer that holds it, with buffer numbers running from 1 to 100.

<P>
Additional information about each image is stored in an associated
<I>header</I>, also stored in memory.  The header is structured on
the FITS header format, and contains a table of values describing the
properties of the image, including the image dimensions and data format,
observing information, etc.  These are always associated with an image and
are automatically copied or adjusted if the image itself is copied or
adjusted.  

<P>
A <I>spectrum</I> is a one-dimensional array of numbers representing the
amount of light at each wavelength interval from an astronomical object.  A
CCD used for spectroscopy does not produce a spectrum directly; rather, it
records a two-dimensional image of the spread-out light behind the slit and
grating.  This image is later converted (''mashed'') into a spectrum.
Spectra are stored in the same buffers that are used for images.  A
spectrum is an image with one row.

<P>
Various VISTA programs produce data sets that are neither images nor
spectra.  The buffers for the storing of these data are not referred to by
number, usually because there is only one of each type.  These data can be
saved on the disk (with the SAVE command), retrieved (with GET) or
displayed (PRINT).

<P>
A very important feature of VISTA is <I>procedures</I>.  These are lists
of commands that are executed as a group.  There is a special buffer for
storing procedures, and they may be saved on the disk for repeated
use. Various conditional and looping ability is available in procedures,
allowing repetitive tasks to be easily executed.

<P>
VISTA also has <I>variables</I>, which are symbolic names for numerical
values or character strings.  Using variables in procedures greatly expands
the power of VISTA, by allowing the user to write complex
programs. However, VISTA is not a fully flexible programming language; it
does not have full array capabilities (although the image buffers
themselves can be used as one or two dimensional arrays). The command
parsing is also not highly sophisticated.

<P>
VISTA has adopted the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format for all
images (although we can read a variety of related image formats, FITS is
preferred).  A complete description of the FITS format may be found at the
FITS Support Office Home Page at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
