EMARK: Interactively Specify Ellipse Parameters for 
        Photometry with EMAG</A>

<P>
EMARK enables the user to mark with the cursor the radius at which the
ellipse parameters to be used by the routine EMAG are to be taken. The
image must be displayed, and the PROFILE common block loaded, in order for
EMARK to work. It is advisable to have displayed the elliptical isophotes
with TVPROF prior to running EMARK.

<P>
EMARK will prompt the user to move the cursor to the position (along the
major axis) of the ellipse whose shape and orientation is the one desired
for use in EMAG photometry. The user then strikes the key ;SPMquot;P;SPMquot;. A cross will
be displayed at this point, and the user will be given the option of
choosing another position. Once the user is satisfied with the position
chosen, EMARK will compute the distance of this point from the ellipse
center. This distance is then loaded into the VISTA variable ERAD.

<P>
When EMAG is run with ERAD as a keyword, values of the PROFILE common block
near the radius specified by EMARK are averaged in order to obtain the
position angles, ellipticities, and centers of the elliptical apertures
used by EMAG.

<P>
Following the marking of the radius defining ERAD, EMARK asks the user if
it is desired to mark the maximum radius for photometry. If so, the user is
again prompted to move the cursor to this position and strike the key ;SPMquot;P;SPMquot;;
again the distance from the center is computed, and loaded into the VISTA
variable RMAX.
