VISTA has a package of programs designed to measure stellar brightnesses on
CCD pictures. Many of these are taken from the DAOPHOT stellar photometry
package originally written by Peter Stetson. Some additional routines are
included for interaction with the video display and some modifications have
been made to the DAOPHOT routines. The various DAOPHOT programs estimate
the total counts in each star on a frame -- no attempt is made to convert
these counts to magnitudes on some standard system. Some additional
routines are included to help with this transformation.

<P>
The version of DAOPHOT which is included in VISTA is an adaptation of
Stetson's 1987 version of the code. Subsequently, Stetson has made
modifications to the standard distribution of DAOPHOT which are NOT
included in the VISTA package. In addition, some modification of the
original DAOPHOT code was necessary to make it work inside of VISTA.
Several new options were added as well by Jon Holtzman. Because of these
facts, Stetson can NOT be help responsible for any results that come out of
the VISTA/DAOPHOT routines. From extensive use of the code, we feel the
routines are reliable, but this cannot be absolutely guaranteed. We are
very grateful to Peter Stetson for allowing us to incorporate his code.

<P>
If you wish to use a Stetson's up-to-date version of DAOPHOT, contact him
for the source code, and simply use VISTA to write out the data in some
format which the standalone DAOPHOT can read.

<P>
Any questions about the VISTA/DAOPHOT routines should be addressed to the
VISTA distributors and not to Stetson. Publications using the VISTA/DAOPHOT
routines should give credit both to VISTA and to Stetson but remember, he
cannot be help responsible for the results.

<P>
The inclusion of DAOPHOT is new to VISTA Version 4. Some of the old VISTA
commands have been discarded because they are less accurate and rather
difficult to make portable.  Gone are FITSTAR, PSF, and BFITSTAR, the old
VISTA routines used for point spread function fitting (although note there
is now a new command FITSTAR which does something entirely different,
namely fits for extinction and transformation coefficients given observed
and standard photometry).

<P>
The DAOPHOT routines are discussed below (or CTRL-C out of this and type
HELP DAOPHOT if you are on a terminal and want to skip straight to the
DAOPHOT information). Generally, extensive information on the DAOPHOT
routines is NOT given in this manual. Consult the DAOPHOT manual for more
details.

<P>
Besides the DAOPHOT routines, VISTA has two routines to find stellar
objects in a given field, MARKSTAR and AUTOMARK. MARKSTAR is extremely
useful, as it allows the user to interactively enter stars, display stars
in a photometry list, and access information about a star specified with
the cursor on the display. Positions are found by interactively marking
stars. The stored position is computed by centroiding around the cursor
location. AUTOMARK finds objects automatically in a similar way, without
any help from the user. It requires a range of peak values as input which
is uses to decide what are stars.

<P>
Aperture brightnesses in circular apertures can be measured quickly using
APERSTAR, which total counts in an aperture of specified size around all
stars on a photometry list. More sophisticated aperture photometry is
available in DAOPHOT using the PHOTOMETRY command.

<P>
VISTA includes several commands for the processing of instrumental
magnitudes: COMBINE lets one combine lists of stars from several frames,
MAGAVER computes the weighted mean and other statistics from output from
COMBINE, and FITSTAR allows one to get extinction and transformation
coefficients. The routines REGISTER and OFFSET allow one to determine the
linear plate coefficients from the positions of stars on different frames
and to correct the DAOPHOT files for these plate transformations. 

<P>
Most of the programs use a <B>photometry file</B>.  
This is a series of records
which contain information about the location, brightness, and type of
observation for each star.  There is one record per star. The photometry
file is <B>not</B> currently used by the DAOPHOT routines.

<P>

The VISTA photometry file is stored internally in the VISTA program as a
common block.  It is NOT automatically written to the disk. You have to
save the results you make with the photometry routines using the SAVE
command. Similarly, you can connect a photometry file to the program with
the GET command. The photometry files are stored in the data directory (See
PRINT DIRECTORIES) with the extension .PHO, unless you specify otherwise
(DAOPHOT files have default extension .COO).  If you are using the DAOPHOT
routines, all results are stored in disk files just as in standalone
DAOPHOT.
