<P>
When the PAUSE command is encountered in a procedure, VISTA prints the
prompt 'PAUSE ' followed by the rest of the (optional) prompt which appears
on the command line.  The execution of the procedure is then stopped.
While paused, you can enter any commands in the normal immediate mode of
execution.  To resume the procedure where it paused type the command
CONTINUE.  You do not need to type a command to permanently halt the
procedure.  If you give the command GO any previous pause state will be
canceled, and VISTA will start the program from the beginning.

<P>
WARNING: ALWAYS place a PAUSE instruction on its own line in a procedure.
A procedure which looks like
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim131#</PRE>
will pause properly, but CONTINUE will start the procedure with 
command 4, not command 3.

<P>
