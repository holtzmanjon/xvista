<P>
This command can be used to print out arithmetic expressions.  Up to 15
expressions can be printed out at one time.

<P>
Examples:
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#example852#
<BR>

<P>
NOTE: the expressions which TYPE will accept must have at least one
non-numeric character in them.  This means that the expressions must
contain at least one variable name OR at least one arithmetic operator.
Thus, something like
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#hanging856#
<BR>
will not work.

<P>
The command PRINTF allows you to print expressions in a designated format.
