<P>
PHOTONS creates artificial stars and/or noise on an already existing
image. If no image exists, use CREATE to make one. It makes as many stars
as you want with whatever brightnesses you want. You can specify where to
put each star, or you can place them randomly on the image, or you can read
in positions from an external file. You can use a coarse Gaussian to
represent the PSF with whatever FWHM, or you can give a PSF to the program
to read from a preexisting disk file. You can use a DAOPHOT style PSF to
create images, or a PSFLIB file. You can store the information (position
and counts) about the created stars in a VISTA photometry file.

<P>
Without preparing an external file, you can either create one star at a
specified position or one or more stars at random positions. For a
specified position,use AT=r,c; if this keyword isn't used, positions will
be random on the frame, unless the STR= keyword is used. Specify the number
of stars desired using NSTARS=n.The number of counts in each star is
determined from the COUNTS=c1,c2 keyword. Each star will have a total
number of counts randomly distributed in the range c1 to c2. If you want a
star to have a particular number of counts c1, just set c2=c1+1.

<P>
To make stars from a list on disk, prepare a file with four columns:
ID,COL(X), ROW(Y), COUNTS.  Any format is OK, as long as there are spaces
between the numbers. Specify the filename with STR=filename and your stars
will be made.

<P>
The PSFs of the stars can be a Gaussian of whatever FWHM you desire, or it
can be integrated external disk file with a 1-D PSF, or you can use a PSF
created by the DAOPHOT PSF routine to create stars, or you can specify a
PSF library file to use. For a Gaussian PSF, use the GAUSS keyword along
with FW=FWHM to specify the FWHM. For an arbitrary symmetric PSF from a
disk file, use FILE=file to specify the file name. This file can contain up
to 1000 numbers with the profile of your desire tabulated. The program
converts this profile to a pixel scale using the FW= keyword to tell it how
many pixels corresponds to the NTABLE entries. The file should be a
formatted disk file written with (Fortran):
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim509#</PRE>
Note that the ``formatted'' write statement in Fortran makes a file that is
machine-dependent, and such files are generally not exportable to other
machine/operating-system architectures.

<P>
To use a DAOPHOT PSF, use the DAOPSF=file to specify the file name of the
DAOPHOT .PSF file.

<P>
For all the file options, the V_DATADIR is the default directory.

<P>
Unless requested, noise will not be added to the image. To add noise, use
MEAN=mean and/or RN=rn. MEAN adds a constant value to all pixels in the
image, then computes noise for each pixel and adds it on. RN will add
readout noise to the image. Note that mean and rn are to be given in
counts. To get the correct noise, you also need to specify a gain (with
GAIN=gain) in units of photons per count. Recall, if MEAN is greater than
or equal to 0, noise will be added. Consequently if you want to add stars
to an image more than once, you will add photon noise each time if MEAN
is ;SPMgt;= 0.  The default values are -1 for mean (no noise added), 0 for RN (no
noise added), and 1 for GAIN. The most useful technique is to add sets of
stars with MEAN=-1, and when all stars are finally placed, run PHOTONS with
MEAN=the desired sky level.

<P>
To store the information about the created stars (their positions and
brightnesses) in a VISTA photometry file, use the PHOT keyword. For a new
file, use the NEW keyword (NEW implies PHOT).
