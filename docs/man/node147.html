POWERS generates the periodogram power spectrum estimate from the 1D or 2D
fourier transform of a real image. The periodogram estimate is just a way
to normalize the power spectrum such that Parseval's theorem holds
(i.e. the sum of all the power terms equals the mean squared amplitude of
the transform).

<P>
POWERS only operates on fourier transforms generated with VISTA command
FFT. If you want to generate the power spectrum from a more general
complex image (p.e. an image synthesized with command CMPLX) which is
supposed to be the fourier transform of a real image, use command CABS to
get the modulus of the transform and multiply it by itself (with MULT not
CMULT since the modulus of a complex image is real). The periodogram
estimate and the modulus-squared are basically identical (they may only
differ in the 0th and Nyquist frequencies).
