RMARK: Interactively Set Maximum Radius for EMAG</A>

<P>
RMARK enables the user to interactively set the maximum radius for the
photometry routine EMAG. The image on which photometry is to be performed
must be displayed, and an AXES computation must have been previously
performed, in order for RMARK to work.

<P>
RMARK will prompt the user to move the cursor to a point at the distance
from the object center to which the photometry is to be performed. The user
then strikes the key ;SPMquot;P;SPMquot;. A cross will be displayed at this point and the
user will be given the option of choosing another position. Once the user
is satisfied with the position chosen, RMARK will compute the distance of
this point from the object center. This distance is then loaded into the
VISTA variable RMAX.

<P>
When RMAX is given as a command line keyword in EMAG, the value of this
variable is retrieved and the photometry proceeds out to this radius.
