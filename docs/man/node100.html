<P>
MASKTOIM creates an image, showing which pixels are masked.  Masked pixels
are set to 0 in the image, while unmasked pixels are set to 1.

<P>
Use BOX=b to define the image size and location.  This makes the new image
have the size and location of box 'b'.  See BOX for instructions for
defining boxes.

<P>
You may also give the size and location of the new image with the keywords
SR, SC, NR, and NC.  NR and NC are required.  If SR or SC are not given,
they default to zero.

<P>
Any image already in the destination buffer is destroyed.
