<P>
Finds stars in buffer <I>im</I> over a local threshold value. 
The threshold and low bad pixel value can be set
with the THRESH= and LOWBAD= keywords, or else they will be prompted for in
the normal DAOPHOT fashion. If THRESH= is specified, program won't ask user
to confirm (or change) the value of THRESH after finding stars unless the INT keyword is
also used. The program will prompt for a file in which to store the
coordinates unless the command DAOFILES COO=file has been previously
issued, in which case the coordinates will be stored automatically in the
specified file.

<P>
FIND attempts to find objects which have a FWHM similar to that specified by
the FWHM option by convolving the image with a gaussian of the specified
FWHM before looking for objects (see the DAOPHOT manual and/or the source
code for more precise details). After finding objects, some simple image
statistics are computed for each object called SHARP and ROUND. SHARP measures
the ``peakiness'' of the object and has values between 0 (not sharp) and
2 (very sharp). ROUND measures the azimuthal symmetry of an object and has
values between -2 and 2. Only objects with SHARP and ROUND between the
allowed values specified by the options LS/HS and LR/HR are taken as final
detections.
