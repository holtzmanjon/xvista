<P>
Many (but not all!) programs that produce large amounts of information may
have their output REDIRECTED by the user.  The output from these programs
normally goes to the terminal, but instead can be written to a file or to
the line-printer.

<P>
To redirect the output, you use the '<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline548#' or '<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline550#' constructions at the
end of a valid command.  A single <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline552# will write the output to a new file
(overwriting one if it already exists).  A <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline554# will append to an existing
file, or create a new file if the named file does not exist. If you use the
output redirection '<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline556#lp:', then the output will be printed on your
printer (using the lpr command to the default printer).

<P>
Recall that you cannot have any spaces in a word on the command line; this
applies to output direction as well. Do not put a space after the <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline558# and
before your file name!
