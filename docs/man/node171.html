FINDPEAK maps the vertical (row-axis) location of the peak (maximum) down
each column of an image, or the horizontal (column-axis) location of the
peak running down each row using the COLS keyword. The mapping is done and
stored in a ;SPMquot;spectrum;SPMquot; in an analogous fashion to the centroiding part of
command SPECTROID. The MEDIAN and AREA=fa allows for mapping not of the
location of the peak, but of the row at which a certain fractional area is
reached (the median in particular),
