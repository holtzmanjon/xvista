<P>
WPREP writes a record into a batch surface photometry preparation file
opened using OPREP.  The data written in each record are as follows:

<UL>
<LI><#7119#>SKY value (from VISTA variable SKY)<#7119#>
</LI>
<LI><#7120#>max. radius for photometry (from variable RMAX)<#7120#>
</LI>
<LI><#7121#>estimated HWHM for the PSF (from variable PSF)<#7121#>
</LI>
<LI><#7122#>contents of the AXES block (from AXES)<#7122#>
</LI>
<LI><#7123#>image header.<#7123#>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This information is formatted to be read by RPREP.  The file must have
already been opened with write-access using the `OPREP W' command.

<P>
NOTE: You must compute the image parameters above ahead of time, either
outside of VISTA or using the AXES command without the CORR option.
