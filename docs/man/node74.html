<P>
CLOSE allows you to close one of the ASCII text files which you have
previously opened with the OPEN command.  You may occasionally want to do
this because there can be only five (5) OPEN'ed files at one time.  

<P>
In general it is a good practice to CLOSE all files OPEN'ed by a procedure
at the end, as files opened by a procedure are not automatically closed
when the procedure terminates.
