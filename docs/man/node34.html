PEDIT: Edit the Procedure Buffer</A>

<P>
PEDIT loads the procedure buffer into a temporary file in your current
directory, then runs a process which allows you to edit it with the default
editor (usually vi).  If you exit the editor and save changes, the modified
procedure is loaded back into the procedure buffer, but not executed.  If
quit the editor without saving changes, the procedure buffer is left
unchanged.

<P>
On a UNIX system, you can use another editor by defining the environment
variable VISUAL. For example, to use the vi editor, jus execute the
following BEFORE running VISTA:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim111#</PRE>
A maximum number of 2500 lines is allowed in a procedure.  If you leave the
editor with EXIT and your procedure contains more than 2500 lines, it is
truncated and the last line is set to 'END'.  Also, each line is allowed a
maximum length of 80 characters. You can have longer lines by using
<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="line continuation">linecontinue.html</A>
as described
earlier.

<P>
You may also define procedures (with a maximum length of 2500 lines) with
the editor before running VISTA, and read them into the procedure buffer
with RP or execute them with CALL.
