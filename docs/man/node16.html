<P>
The command HISTORY will show on your terminal the last 50 commands that
you have executed.  Use this to find commands that you want to repeat with
the <tex2html_percent_mark> substitution character.

<P>
The output from HISTORY can be redirected.  As an example:
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#hanging428#
<BR>
prints the recent command history to the file history.txt in your
current working directory.

<P>
