<P>
Shifts positions of all stars in a given file by a specified amount. The
amount can be specified with the DX= and DY= keywords, or else the program
will prompt the user for values. In addition, OFFSET has a new VISTA
function. If a buffer is specified with the OFFSET command, a linear plate
transformation will be performed from the header cards REF_AX ... in the
specified header. These cards are automatically loaded into the header
using the REGISTER command, with the LOAD keyword. See REGISTER for more
information.  If INV is specified, the inverse transformation is done.

<P>
