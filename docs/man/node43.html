PARAMETER evaluate parameters passed to a procedure.  An example will show
best how PARAMETER works.  Suppose the following command was typed:
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#hanging1337#
<BR>
The parameter list portion of the command line is saved, i.e.  '2 X
IMAGEFILE'.  The procedure TEST.PRO is then called.  TEST has in it the
command
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#hanging1340#
<BR>
BUFNUM and FACTOR are taken to be variable names and are associated with
the first two parameters from the parameter list.  In effect it does the
command SET BUFNUM=2 FACTOR=X.  Note that '2' and 'X' could have been any
arithmetic expression.

<P>
The STRING= keyword means that the third parameter is used as a literal
string and the string variable name FILENAME is given the string value
IMAGENAME, in effect doing the command:
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#hanging1343#
<BR>

<P>
If there are fewer parameters in the CALL than required in the PARAMETER
command, the missing parameters are taken to be 0 or blank, as appropriate.

<P>
Note that there is only one area in VISTA for saving the list of passed
parameters, so the PARAMETER command should be executed before calling
another procedure.
