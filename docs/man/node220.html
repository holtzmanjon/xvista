<P>
COORDS finds the right ascension and declination for each star in a
photometry file.  At least three of the stars must have had their R.A. and
Declination. entered in MARKSTAR or in MODPHOT.  The coordinates for the
standards must all be at the same epoch. (One day we will have a precession
program.)

<P>
COORDS works by solving a least-square relation between the rectangular
coordinates on the image (i.e., row and column) and the spherical
coordinates on the sky. The program calculates the coordinates for every
star in the photometry file based on the standard positions you have
entered, including the standard stars. The input positions, calculated
positions, and difference in seconds of time for the standards will be
displayed on your terminal. The program will then print the positions of
the standards.

<P>
The difference between the input and the calculated positions should be
small and evenly distributed about zero. If not, one or more of your input
coordinates is possibly wrong.  Use MODPHOT to change that coordinate, and
try again.  Note that the difference is in seconds of arc for both the
declination and the right ascension.

<P>
If you want to save the coordinates computed by the MODPHOT command, you
must use the 'SAVE PHOT=filename' command.

<P>
The output of COORDS can be redirected.  See HELP REDIRECT for information
about the redirection mechanism.
