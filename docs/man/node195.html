<P>
TVPROF will display the ellipses contained in the PRF common block as a
result of a PROFILE or EMAG calculation. The ellipses are drawn on the TV
display. There must be an image displayed in order for TVPROF to work. This
image should be the one for which the model elliptical isophotes were
computed, although TVPROF has no way of knowing what image is displayed, of
course. TVPROF is intended for use in conjunction with CPROF, for the
purpose of inspecting and modifying the results of galaxy surface
photometry calculations.
