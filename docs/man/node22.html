<P>
CD will change the current working directory (./) of VISTA to be
path_name.  This working directory will remain current until either you
issue CD again, or you exit VISTA.  On exiting VISTA, you will be in the
*original* working directory from which you executed VISTA.

<P>
CD is most useful when you have defined the default image directory to the
current working directory, (./), allowing you to navigate among different
directories containing data of interest without having to redefine the
default image directory each time with the SETDIR command.  It also defines
the current working directory for shell commands ($).
