<P>
Fits stars in buffer im simultaneously using groups created by GROUP.
Requires an input PSF file and an input GROUP file, which will be prompted
for, or can be specified with the DAOFILES PSF=psffile GRP=grpfile
command. The output file can be given with the DAOFILES PRO=outfile
command, or it will be prompted for. The NCLIP= keyword allows the user to
set the number of iterations required in NSTAR before pixels which do not
seem to fit will have the weights reduced.  The standard value of NCLIP in
VISTA is 5. In Stetson's version of DAOPHOT, NCLIP effectively has the
value of 1 (although this may depend on the exact version of DAOPHOT).
