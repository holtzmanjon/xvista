REGISTER: Compute a Linear Plate Solution Between Several Images</A>

<P>
REGISTER solves for the coefficients of a linear plate transformation given
the positions of at least 3 stars appearing in all the frames
concerned. The plate transformation is of the form:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim494#</PRE>
The reference frame is taken to be the first frames specified, but shifted
in rows and columns so that the positions of the reference stars average to
0; if the NOMEAN keyword is used, then the first frame will be the
reference frame, with no shift at all ( this should be the default, but
isn't for historical reasons - this may change someday ...)

<P>
If the HEADER option is specified, the stellar positions are read from the
image header in cards(RSTARX1,RSTARY1),(RSTARX2,RSTARY2), (RSTARX3,RSTARY3)
... up to a maximum of 9 stars.  These cards can be placed in the header
using the MARKSTAR command specifying a buffer number and the keyword
REF. If the HEADER option is not used, the program will prompt for two
files containing the stellar positions in each of two frames. In this case,
only 2 frames can be done at a time.

<P>
If the LOAD keyword is specified, then the coefficients of the fits are
loaded into each header in the cards REF_AX, REF_BX, REF_CX, REF_AY,
REF_BY, and REF_CY.
