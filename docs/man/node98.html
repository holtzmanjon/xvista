BOX: Define a Box or Image Subsection

<P>
VISTA can store the specifications for up to 20 boxes defining image
sub-sections.  These parameters can be used by other commands (such as TV,
WINDOW and PRINT) by including 'BOX=' in the command line, modifying these
commands so they operate only on the designated subsection.

<P>
When a box is initially defined, the size of the box in both dimensions
center must be specified; use both the NR and NC keywords, or for the case
of a square box, the N= keyword may also be used.  If the origin or center
is not given, the box is assumed to start at row 0 and column 0.  You may
change the origin and size of the box later by entering only the changes on
the command line.  All parameters not given on the command line are left
unchanged.

<P>
By default, the VISTA boxes have fixed origins, so if you only change the
box size, then the origin with be preserved. By using the CENT keyword,
however, you can change this to a center based system, where the center of
the box will be preserved. The CENT keyword acts as a toggle switch between
the two modes - once it is set in one mode, it remains in that mode until
explicitly changed by the user.

<P>
The INT command allows you to define boxes interactive on the video
display. Follow the instructions given.

The locations of the defined boxes can be found with the PRINT BOXES
command.

All spectra have start row 0 and 1 row.  Thus, to define a box for use with
spectra, use

You can display the boundaries of defined boxes on the television. See the
command TVBOX.
