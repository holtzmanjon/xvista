<P>
RECON will reconstruct a smooth idealized image from a surface photometry
profile of a galaxy, star, or any other centrally condensed object. The
PROFILE command is used to generate the original profile.  This routine
uses high resolution interpolation to estimate the intensity of the
original object at any pixel in the image array.  The reconstructed image
is faithful to the original brightness, and isophote position angle and
ellipticity profiles, but has perfectly elliptical isophotes.  In some
sense then, the reconstructed object looks like the original object, but
smoothed around a contour.  The reconstructed image can then be compared to
the original to look for faint and subtle features.

<P>
The reconstructed image is centered on the same pixel coordinates as the
original image. This can be adjusted with the CR and CC keywords. The
reconstruction extends only as far as the surface photometry profile;
pixels outside of the photometry area are left untouched.

<P>
Note that the reconstructed object is placed in an image that already
exists.  Use CREATE to make a new image if one does not exist, or make a
copy of the original image.

<P>
The reconstruction is based upon either the most recent surface-brightness
profile computed using PROFILE, or a previously computed fit saved to disk
with the SAVE PROF= command, and read back into memory with the GET PROF=
command.
