This command allows you the change the object name of the image or spectrum
held in buffer number 'buf'.  The object name of an image is the value of
its OBJECT keyword in the FITS header.  The new image name can be given on
the command line or it can be given in response to the prompt if CHANGE
is issued with no arguments.

<P>
If the new name is given on the command line, it must be enclosed in quotes
if it is more than one word long.  

<P>
If the new name is not given on the command line, VISTA will type the
current object name and prompt you for the new name.  If you respond with
only a carriage return then the old name is left unchanged.  To force a
blank object name you must enter at least one space character before the
carriage return.
