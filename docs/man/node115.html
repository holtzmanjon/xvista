<P>
The mean of all the pixels in the image contained in buffer 'source' is
computed.  Use MASK or NOZERO to ignore masked or zero-valued pixels in the
computation.  PIX=p computes the mean using every p'th pixel in every p'th
row, for speed.

<P>
The computed mean value is printed at the terminal (unless the SILENT word
is given) and is also loaded into the VISTA variable Mn, where 'n' is the
image buffer number. (ex: the command MN 1 loads the variable M1.  The
command MN 31 loads the variable MN31).  The value of the mean is also
loaded into the variable MEAN.

<P>
The mean is used by other commands such as the TV command for a default
display range, or the DIVIDE command for rescaling images after flat-field
divisions.

<P>
See MASK for the operation of the pixel mask.
