<P>
CLPROF sets all parameters in the PRF common block to zero. CLPROF should
always be used when the command GET PROF= is used to overwrite the existing
contents of the profile block with new profile parameters stored in a .pro
file. If CLPROF is not run, and if the profile being overwritten is larger
than the new one, the old parameters will remain in the common block for
radii larger than the maximum radius of the new profile.

<P>
To retain the existing profile parameters out to a given radius, setting
them to zero beyond this, the optional keyword RAD=r may be given. All
profile parameters corresponding to radii greater than or equal to r are
then set to zero. This is valuable if a PROFILE calculation is seen to have
gone awry beyond a certain radius.
