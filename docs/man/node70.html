Non-Image Data Files used by VISTA
</H1> 
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>rawhtml238#

<P>
In addition to images and spectra, VISTA generates a number of auxiliary
non-image data structures.  Some VISTA commands produce data that are
stored internally in Fortran COMMON blocks.  These data can be saved into
disk files using the SAVE command described below and can be read back into
VISTA at a later time using the GET command.  The PRINT command is used to
show the contents of these auxiliary data structures.

<P>
VISTA can also read numeric and alphanumeric data from ASCII text files.
The commands for manipulating these files are:
