GOTO tells VISTA to jump to a line in the procedure buffer beginning with
``label_name:''.  The label_name can be any alphanumeric string.  You can
jump out of, but not into, a procedure DO loop or IF block.  In the latter
cases, VISTA will trigger an error condition and abort the procedure.  The
jump can be in either direction in the procedure buffer (either before or
after the GOTO command in the procedure).

<P>
The jump-point label may be any valid string terminated with a ':' (color)
immediately following the label.  No other commands can appear following
the label on the same line.  Note that the ':' is omitted in the GOTO
statement.

This jumps forward over the intervening lines to the label ``WHEREVER:''.

<#1521#>Example 2:<#1521#>

This exectues the lines, then jumps backwards to the label NOWHERE: and
executes them again.
