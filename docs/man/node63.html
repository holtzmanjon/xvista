<P>
CREATE creates a new blank image, giving all the pixels in that image some
constant value (the default is 0.0).  Any image that is in the buffer will
be destroyed.  Use CONST=c to set the initial values of all of the pixels
to 'c'.

<P>
The BOX=b keyword is used to define the image size and location.  This
makes the new image have the size and location of bux 'b'.  See BOX for
instructions for defining boxes. You may also give the size and location of
the new image with the keywords SR, SC, NR, NC, or N.  NR and NC, or N, are
required.  If SR, SC , CR, and CC are not given, the default origin is
(0,0).

<P>
If you wish to have the header cards in the new buffer populated with cards
from an existing buffer (except for cards having to do with image size,
origin, etc.), use the HEADBUF=oldbuf keyword to copy cards from buffer
<I>oldbuf</I>.
