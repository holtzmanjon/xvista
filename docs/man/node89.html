TVRPLOT: Radial Intensity Plot of an Object on the Image Display</A>

<P>
This program makes a simple radial intensity plot of a section of an image.
If the object is a star, it shows a mean point-spread function profile.  An
non-interactive version is available via the RPLOT command.

<P>
The radial intensity plot is formed by finding the radius to all points
within a given box around the specified location and plotting intensity
versus radius.  Each point making up the plot is from a single pixel; no
interpolation is done.  The effect is to produce an azimuthally wrapped
(not averaged) plot of intensity.  For example, if doing TVRPLOT on the
image of a star, if that star is round, then a fairly clean radial
point-spread function profile, will be plotted.  If the star is elliptical
(due to bad guiding or focus), the radial brightness profile will be a
fuzzy cloud of points.

<P>
The center of the radial plot may be specified in one of two ways:

<OL>
<LI><#3047#>;SPMquot;C;SPMquot;: The center is the intensity centroid nearest the 
             cursor, computed using the same algorithm used by MARKSTAR and
             AUTOMARK.<#3047#>
</LI>
<LI><#3048#>;SPMquot;X;SPMquot;: The center is the pixel where the display cursor
             is located.  No centroid is computed in this case.<#3048#>
</LI>
</OL>
The radius axis on the plot may be scaled to arcseconds using the SCALE=
keyword.  Note that using SCALE will not affect the size of the search
radius; this is always expressed in pixel units.

<P>
NOERASE suppresses erasing of the plotting window, allowing you to
superimpose subsequent radial plots on top of each other.  

<P>
LOG will plot the logarithm of the intensity as a function of radius.

<P>
COLOR=c changes
the color of the points plotted.  The default color is white (1).  At
present only the 7 ;SPMquot;primary;SPMquot; graphics colors are available:

<P>
Colors may be used in conjunction with NOERASE to overlay two different
radial profiles, using the colors to distinguish them.

<P>
See RPLOT for the non-interactive (batch) version of this program.
