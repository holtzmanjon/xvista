TV: Display an Image

<P>
For more general TV help, type HELP X11.

<P>
TV displays the image in 'buf' on the X11 image display.  Only those pixels
with data numbers between Z and Z+L are displayed.  Data values greater
than the maximum are all shown as one color, although the interactive
cursor will still be able to display the data associated with the ;SPMquot;clipped;SPMquot;
pixels.

<P>
If no intensity scaling is given on the command line, TV will assume Z=0
and L=3 times the image mean intensity.  If the mean has not been
calculated, TV will do a quick calculation using every 9th pixel.  A peak
intensity of 4x the mean is a reasonable values to use for many
astronomical images with a large dynamic range.  It is not so good,
however, for viewing flat fields, skies, or dark images that have a narrow
range of data values.  In the latter case, you should specify the display
levels explicitly on the command line.

<P>
BOX=n tells TV to only display that part of the image within box 'n'
(see BOX command).

<P>
OLD tells TV to use the same display limits as the previous image.

<P>
CF=filename loads the color map (;SPMquot;look-up table;SPMquot;) used to translate
pixel values into colors.  'BW' loads a black and white color map.  Once
the map is loaded, it remains in effect until changed by either the
COLOR or subsequent TV commands.

<P>
The basic set of color maps is:
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#example2602#
<BR>
More are available, see the COLOR command for specifics.

<P>
The NCOLOR= keyword can be used to limit the number of colors displayed in
X windows.  By default, 256 colors are displayed.  A limited color map is
useful when VISTA is being run at the same time as other color-hungry
applications (e.g., SAOimage, or web browsers like Netscape).  If VISTA
asks for too many colors, the X server can refuse to open the image
display.  An alternative is to shut down the unneeded applications when
running VISTA.

<P>
The TV display uses a 4-place ;SPMquot;ring buffer;SPMquot; to hold the 4 most recently
displayed images in memory.  You can page through these images using the
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline3413# and <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline3415# keys when the mouse is on the TV display window.  Blinking may
be accomplished by displaying two images sequentially, and then using the
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline3417# keys to blink between them.

<P>
If the blink buffers are getting filled with a confusing mix of images, the
CLEAR IMAGES command may be used to clean them out (except for the
currently displayed image) and allow you to start over again.

<P>
The default image coordinates are as follows:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim265#</PRE>

<P>
The origin is at the upper left-hand corner, with columns increasing to the
left and rows increasing from top to bottom.  This is the ;SPMquot;natural;SPMquot; order
in which to directly map images from memory onto the display, and allows us
to display images as fast as possible without remapping.

<P>
The FLIP keyword is provided to invert the rows axis so as to increase
vertically from bottom to top, i.e., in ``Cartesian'' coordinate order.
This will give you an orientation that is more ``natural'' from the user's
point of view, but which incurs some performance penalty.

<P>
The properties of the display (size, whether or not to auto-dezoom, etc.)
can be customized using X resources variables set in the user's .Xdefaults
file.  See HELP X11 for an overview.

<P>
Whenever an image is in the display, a set of basic cursor keys are
available to provide simple interactive capabilities.  See HELP X11 for
details.
