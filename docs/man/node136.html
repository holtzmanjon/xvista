SPLINE is used to fit splines to images or spectra.  When used with images,
it replaces each row (or column) with splines fitted with designated
columns (or rows) as knot points.  When used with (wavelength calibrated)
spectra, it replaces the spectrum with the best fitting spline with
designated columns (Angstroms) as knot points.
