TEMPLATE generates either a Gaussian (GAUSS), exponential disk (EXP),
Hubble (HUB), or deVaucouleurs (DEV) template from an input profile spectrum
originally calculated using the CUT or PROFILE command.  The Eccentricity,
Position Angle of the brightness profile stored in the spectrum, and the
Position Angle of the Major axis are all stored in a common block and
generally need not be reloaded using the appropriate keywords.  These
keywords permit the user to ;SPMquot;fine tune;SPMquot; the fit in the event that the
loaded parameters are not ideal.  The actual nonlinear least squares fit to
the appropriate brightness law is carried out for spectrum points n1
through n2 using the FIT= keyword.  This permits, for example, fitting an
exponential disk to the outer portions of the brightness profile while
leaving the central (perhaps bulge) component alone.  At this time only one
surface brightness law at a time can be fit.

<P>
N.B.The user must have an image with the same characteristics (size, etc.)
as the template already in the destination buffer.  This image will of
course be overwritten by the generated template.  The SUB keyword permits
the subtraction of the generated template from the image already in the
destination buffer.
