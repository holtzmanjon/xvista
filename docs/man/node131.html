TVZAP works on the image that is loaded into the television.  It performs
the ZAP operation (see HELP ZAP) on those pixels selected by the TV cursor.

<P>
SIG=f and TTY have the same meaning as in ZAP.  SEARCH is used to select
the size of the region which is median filtered.  The region is a square
box of size 's', where 's' is the argument to the SEARCH word. 's' has a
maximum size of 50.  If the word SEARCH is not given, the default is a 5 by
5 box.  The MASK keyword is the same as for the ZAP command.

<P>
The SURGICAL keyword means to test only the pixel directly beneath the
cursor for zapping.  By default TVZAP (like ZAP or LZAP) will test 
<I>all</I> pixels within the current median window, and replace them
with the median if they exceed the rejection threshold.

<P>
After you type TVZAP, the cursor will appear on the screen.  The usual
cursor keys (see ITV) will then be defined.  Other defined keys are:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">Z</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">perform ZAP operation at position of cursor</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">E</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">exit from TVZAP</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">S</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">change size of box used in median filtering</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">T</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">change rejection threshold</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Move the cursor, in turn, to the regions on the image you want zapped.  Hit
the Z key each time.  The median filtering process will take place, and the
program will tell you how many pixels have been zapped.
