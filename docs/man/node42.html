This command tells VISTA that the execution of the current sub-procedure is
complete and to return to any calling procedure or to immediate input mode
as is appropriate.  This command is intended to allow a return from the
procedure as a result of an IF test. In cases where no condition testing is
needed, the final END command in the procedure buffer will tell VISTA that
the procedure has completed.

<LI><#1371#>Here is an example of a conditional exit from a procedure.
   This procedure may be run with CALL or GO.

<LI><#1372#>END may be used as return ONLY if it is the last command in 
  the file. Thus a procedure like:
  <PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim121#</PRE>
  may be executed as a subroutine, but one that looks like:
  <PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim122#</PRE>
  will not work.  Use RETURN instead.
