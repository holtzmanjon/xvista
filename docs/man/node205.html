<P>
GROUP splits stars into separate groups for possible use during the
PSF-fitting procedure. OLDGROUP (or GROUP with option IGROUP=1) splits
stars just on the basis of the distance to the nearest neighbor, and
needs a critical separation as input. GROUP
(with option IGROUP=0) uses brightness information and information about
the PSF as well, and uses a critical brightness ratio as input.

<P>
GROUP uses as input an output file from
the PHOTOMETRY command. The program will prompt for a critical separation or
critical ratio, or it can be specified with the CRIT= keyword.  The command will
also prompt for an input aperture photometry file, an output group file,
and a PSF file (for GROUP IG=0).  Alternatively, these files can
be specified with the DAOFILES MAG=magfile GRP=grpfile PSF=psffile command.

<P>
