POLAR: Regrid an Image into Polar Coordinates</A>

<P>
POLAR will transform the image in the `source' buffer from observed
Cartesian coordinates (x,y) to polar coordinates (r,theta) in the `dest'
buffer.  The transformation assumes that the object is intrinsically round
and projected into an ellipse in the sky plane with the given position
angle, ellipticity (1-b/a) and center.

<P>
The SINC keyword instructs ROUND to use high-accuracy sinc interpolation
instead of the default bilinear interpolation algorithm.  

<P>
The NORM keyword is used to renormalize the pixel intensities (surface
brightness/pixel) in the transformed image.

<P>
The R=(rmin,rmax) keyword is used to specify the radial limits of the
r-axis of the polar deprojection.  By default, if R= is not given the
r-axis will run from 0 to the maximum semi-major axis of the inscribed
ellipse.
