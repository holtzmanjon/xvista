VISTA procedures allow testing of variables and branching based on the
results of those tests.  This capability greatly expands the usefulness of
procedures.

<P>
The simplest use of IF is to mark a section of a procedure that is executed
only if come condition is true.  It has the form:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim141#</PRE>

<P>
You can also have two level branching:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim142#</PRE>

<P>
These may be strung together:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim143#</PRE>

<P>
The conditions tested by the IF and ELSE_IF statements are really just
VISTA arithmetic expressions.  An expression is considered to be true if it
evaluates to be non-zero, and false otherwise.  VISTA arithmetic supports
various logical operators whose value is either 1 or 0 depending on whether
the logical test is true or false.  The logical operators are the
following, where A and B can represent single VISTA variables or algebraic
expressions.

<P>
There are two logical conjunctions <tex2html_ampersand_mark> (and) and | (or) which can be used to
join several of the above tests. Examples of the conjunctions are below:
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#example1565#

The syntax of the IF statements is designed to look similar to the
FORTRAN-77 IF block structures.  Each IF block must begin with an IF
command and end with the END_IF command.  An algebraic statement to be
tested must follow the IF on the same line.  If the relation is true, then
the procedure commands following the IF command are executed. If the
relation is false, VISTA looks for any ELSE_IF tests, any final ELSE
statement, or jumps to the procedure lines following the END_IF statement.

<P>
The ELSE_IF command also must have a condition to be tested on the same
line.  ELSE_IF's are optional, but permit you to test other conditions and
execute other blocks of the procedure buffer in the event that the initial
IF or any preceding ELSE_IF's are false.  In this way you can allow VISTA
to 'trickle down' through several tests looking for one that is true.

<P>
The ELSE statement is also optional and marks a set of procedure lines for
VISTA to execute if and only if the initial IF and any following ELSE_IF's
all test out false. Basically, the IF, any ELSE_IF's, or any ELSE
statements all mark out various blocks of the procedure to be executed
under different conditions.  After the execution of any block, VISTA
transfers control to the procedure lines following the END_IF statement.

<P>
IF blocks can be nested within other IF blocks up to 15 levels deep.  IF
blocks can be jumped out of, but not into, by the GOTO command. IF blocks
must contain or be contained within DO loops completely. Some examples of
IF blocks are given below:
