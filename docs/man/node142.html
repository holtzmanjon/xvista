<P>
LINCOMB fits a linear combination of input images, stored in VISTA buffers
to an image stored in another VISTA buffer. The user can load the
coefficients of the fit into VISTA variables using the LOAD keyword. The
default action is to replace the image to fit with the fitted image;
however, the input image will be divided by the fit with the DIV keyword,
or the fit will be subtracted from the input image with the SUB keyword.

<P>
The default action is also to fit a constant term in addition to the
specified input images. This can be overridden with the CONST= keyword,
which will use the specified value as the constant term (use CONST=0 to
eliminate constant term altogether).
