<P>
Does aperture photometry on buffer <I>im</I> using input star file.  Unlike
standalone DAOPHOT, a photometry table which gives aperatures, etc., is not
used.  The user can specify pixel radii (up to 30 different
values) with the RAD= keyword to give the desired radii for aperture
photometry. The GAIN= and RN= keywords need to be
used to give proper error estimates. With the RAD= keyword, the SKY is
assumed to be 0 unless it a sky value is supplied with the SKY= keyword, or 
unless two annulus radii are specified with the SKYRAD= keyword 
(which is the normal mode of operation).  A series of
aperture radii in an aritmetic progression can be specified in shorthand using
RAD=-naper,startaper,deltaaper (note that this format is recognized by a
NEGATIVE naper), where naper is the desired total number of apertures,
startaper is the size of the first aperture, and deltaaper is the amount
added to the previous aperture size.

<P>
The keyword SKY= can be used to set a sky value, used for all stars. Normally,
however, one wishes to allow for possible background variations across
the frame, and a sky value is computed from an annulus around each object;
the size of the annulus is specified using the SKYRAD=r1,r2 keyword.
The default mode of operation uses the DAOPHOT MMM routine to compute a
sky value based on an estimate of the mode of the distribution within the
sky annulus. Alternatively, the
keyword MEAN forces a mean sky value to be used,  and the 3SIG keyword
computes an iterated mean with 3-sigma rejection.
The keyword SKYINT will
compute a sky value for each star, then prompt the user to enter a desired 
value for each star.
