TEXT: Embed Permanent Text on an Image

<P>
TEXT is used to add a permanent annotation text to an image by ``poking''
pixel values to render the text.

<P>
The coordinates (X0=, Y0=) give the location in pixels of the upper
left-hand corner of the text box.  You can compute centering of a string
using the cell size and the number of characters in the string.  The TEXT=
keyword is used to give the text string to embed, but if omitted the
program will prompt for the input string.  The text may include any valid
ASCII keyboard characters.

<P>
Text is embedded on the image as a string of 8x11-pixel ASCII characters by
changing the data values of the pixels to 32766.  The height of an
uppercase M is 10 pixels height of a lowercase x is 6 pixels.  Each
character cell has 1 pixel of white space between it and the surrounding
characters, and one pixel of white space below for descenders (e.g., on y
and g).  The size of the text may be scaled larger using the SCALE=
keyword.

<P>
Data pixels under the characters proper are lost, but data between
character pixels is untouched.  If FILL=1 is given, however, the inter-text
pixels are set to 0.0 This provides a way of ``boxing and filling'' the
text so it does not conflict with background data.

<P>
The ROT keyword is used to rotate the text, in increments of 90 degrees.
Since we are using a simple text rendering, odd angles do not work
satisfactorily.

<P>
Note that TEXT makes <B>PERMANENT</B> changes to the data values in the
image being annoted.   To make only temporary labels (drawn on the image
display's ``vector'' plane, not by changing image pixels proper), see the
TVPLOT command.
