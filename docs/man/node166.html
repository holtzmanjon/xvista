<P>
POLY fits a polynomial to the spectrum in image buffer 'source'.  The order
of the polynomial is specified by the keyword 'ORD=n', where n=1 is a line,
n=2 is a quadratic, and so forth.  Here a ``spectrum'' is any 1-D image
vector (an ``image'' with 1 row and NC columns).

<P>
As in the SPLINE command the keywords SUB and DIV can be used to tell the
program to subtract or divide (respectively) the original spectrum by the
fit.  (Without both of these keywords the spectrum will be replaced by the
fit.) As in the SURFACE command the keyword LOAD will load VISTA variables
with the computed polynomial coefficients, so that they are accessible by
other commands.  The names of the variables loaded are COEFF0, COEFF1, ...,
COEFFn, where 'n' is again the order of the fit.  The formula using these
coefficients is

where y is the intensity and x is the pixel number.
