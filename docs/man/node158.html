<P>
WSCALE calculates the wavelength calibration polynomial using the
wavelengths and line centers of the calibration spectrum lines identified
by the LINEID command.  The resulting calibration is associated with the
spectrum specified by 'dest'. The line centers determined with the LINEID
command are fit to a polynomial of order specified by 'ORD=n'. If the
keyword 'INT' is specified, interactive line weighting can be done. The
program will ask for all unspecified parameters.

<P>
The resulting wavelength scale becomes associated with the 'dest'
spectrum. You can then use the COPW command to associate the wavelength
scale with any other spectrum you wish.

<P>
Also, note that it is the REVERSE fit which is actually used by the command
ALIGN to linearize a spectrum (see below).
