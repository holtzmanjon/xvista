Extending Commands Past One Line</A>

<P>
A VISTA command is ordinarily terminated by typing a RETURN, thus limiting
the normal command length to one line of 80 characters.  However, you can
continue a command onto the next line by ending the current line of
characters with the <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline566# character.  The last non-blank character must be a
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline568# for your command to be extended.  You will be prompted for the rest of
the command with a colon on the next line. Example:

<P>
<BR>
<tex2html_image_mark>#hanging468#
<BR>

<P>
There is a limit to the length of a command permitted even when using the
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline572# character, and that limit is 500 characters.

<P>
