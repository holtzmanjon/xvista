<P>
Use UNFIT to delete the specified FITS header card from the header of image
in the specified VISTA buffer.  This image will remove only the first
instance of the card, so if you want to remove multiple COMMENT cards, for
example, the command needs to be issued many times.

<P>
You can delete cards from the internal PROFILE header by using the PROF
keyword, rather than specifying a buffer number.
