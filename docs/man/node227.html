<P>
CORRECT applies photometric corrections to raw data to account for
extinction and/or transformation terms.  It can act either on a number of
types of stellar photometry files (e.g. standard DAOPHOT files or files
that come from the MAGAVER| command), or internally on the surface
brightnesses and magnitudes in the internal PROFILE common block. Besides
the input data, the routine reads a file with the extinction and
transformation coefficients. This file may be created using the FITSTAR
command, or for more simple cases in which you wish to dictate the
extinction and/or transformation coefficients, it may be created by the
user by hand. See the FITSTAR help file for a description of this
transformation (.trn) file.

<P>
When you run CORRECT, the routine will prompt for a transformation file
name, unless you supply one with the TRN=trnfile keyword.  It will list the
various lines in this file and ask you which transformation you wish to
use; alternatively, you can pre-specify the line to use with the LINE=
keyword. If you have observations in more than one color (in MAGAVER
files), you will be asked which magnitude you wish to correct, and which
colors to use for the color terms (or you can specify these with the
COLCOL= keyword).  If you have observations in only one color, you will be
asked if you wish to enter a standard color to use in the transformation
equations, unless you have pre-specified this number using the COLOR=
keyword. The routine will then proceed to apply the transformation
equation(s).

<P>
If you are correct stellar magnitudes, you will be prompted for an input
and output file name.  If you are using the PROF option, the internal
counts in the PROFILE common block will be corrected.  The reduced PROFILE
counts (or magnitudes) can be seen using the PRINT PROF <#7864#>[MAG]<#7864#>
command. With the PROF option, several auxiliary value are computed, namely
the concentration index (ratio of radii that include 25 and 75 percent of
the light), the total magnitude (extrapolated for an exponential disk if
one has been fit using the CPROF command), and the disk-to-total light
ration (using the exponential fit if done). These values are loaded into
the internal PROFILE FITS header, and also printed out with the PRINT PROF
command.

<P>
NOTE: For the PROF option, the counts will be corrected for exposure time
and the airmass computed. This requires that accurate values for EXPOSURE,
RA, DEC, DATE-OBS, and the latitude are available. Since the PROFILE header
is originally copied from the image header, these values should be
available. If they are not, note that cards can be added and/or removed
from the internal PROFILE header using the FITS, UNFIT, or HEDIT command
with the PROF keyword instead of a buffer number.

<P>
