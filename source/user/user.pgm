C  This is the file user.PGM. This is the place to add new
C    commands to the VISTA command tree. Follow the examples.
C  The fake command IMAGE is an example of a command that
C    requires an image. If you require an image, you
C    have to pass the image address, which can't be done
C    using standard FORTRAN. Consequently, we use an
C    intemediate C routine to pass the address by reference.
C    By convention, we name the intermediate routine cc{name}.
C  The fake command NOIMAGE doesn't require it.

C  See the file vista.F in the source directory for more
C    information about the VISTA command tree
